= 3. Working with Beans

Beans are the Model in SuiteCRM’s MVC (Model View Controller)
architecture. They allow retrieving data from the database as objects
and allow persisting and editing records. This section will go over the
various ways of working with beans.

== BeanFactory

The BeanFactory allows dynamically loading bean instances or creating
new records. For example to create a new bean you can use:

*_Example 3.1: Creating a new Bean using the BeanFactory_*


[source,php]
1 $bean = BeanFactory::newBean('<TheModule>');
2 //For example a new account bean:
3 $accountBean = BeanFactory::newBean('Accounts');



Retrieving an existing bean can be achieved in a similar manner:

*_Example 3.2: Retrieving a bean with the BeanFactory_*


[source,php]
1 $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('<TheModule>', $beanId);
2 //For example to retrieve an account id
3 $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('Accounts', $beanId);



`getBean` will return an unpopulated bean object if `$beanId` is not
supplied or if there’s no such record. Retrieving an unpopulated bean
can be useful if you wish to use the static methods of the bean (for
example see the Searching for Beans section). To deliberately retrieve
an unpopulated bean you can omit the second argument of the `getBean`
call. I.e.

*_Example 3.3: Retrieving an unpopulated bean_*


[source,php]
1 $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('<TheModule>');



{{% notice warning %}}
`BeanFactory::getBean` caches ten results. This can cause odd behaviour
if you call `getBean` again and get a cached copy. Any calls that return
a cached copy will return the same instance. This means changes to one
of the beans will be reflected in all the results.
{{% /notice %}}



Using BeanFactory ensures that the bean is correctly set up and the
necessary files are included etc.

== SugarBean

The SugarBean is the parent bean class and all beans in SuiteCRM extend
this class. It provides various ways of retrieving and interacting with
records.

== Searching for beans

The following examples show how to search for beans using a bean class.
The examples provided assume that an account bean is available names
$accountBean. This may have been retrieved using the getBean call
mentioned in the BeanFactory section e.g.

*_Example 3.4: Retrieving an unpopulated account bean_*


[source,php]
$accountBean = BeanFactory::getBean('Accounts');



[discrete]
==== get_list

The get_list method allows getting a list of matching beans and allows
paginating the results.

*_Example 3.5: get_list method signature_*


[source,php]
1 get_list(
2     $order_by = "",
3     $where = "",
4     $row_offset = 0,
5     $limit=-1,
6     $max=-1,
7     $show_deleted = 0)



`$order_by`::
  Controls the ordering of the returned list. `$order_by` is specified
  as a string that will be used in the SQL ORDER BY clause e.g. to sort
  by name you can simply pass `name`, to sort by date_entered descending
  use `date_entered DESC`. You can also sort by multiple fields. For
  example sorting by date_modified and id descending
  `date_modified, id DESC`.
`$where`::
  Allows filtering the results using an SQL WHERE clause. `$where`
  should be a string containing the SQL conditions. For example in the
  contacts module searching for contacts with specific first names we
  might use `contacts.first_name='Jim'`. Note that we specify the table,
  the query may end up joining onto other tables so we want to ensure
  that there is no ambiguity in which field we target.
`$row_offset`::
  The row to start from. Can be used to paginate the results.
`$limit`::
  The maximum number of records to be returned by the query. -1 means no
  limit.
`$max`::
  The maximum number of entries to be returned per page. -1 means the
  default max (usually 20).
`$show_deleted`::
  Whether to include deleted results.

*Results* +
get_list will return an array. This will contain the paging information
and will also contain the list of beans. This array will contain the
following keys:

`list`::
  An array of the beans returned by the list query
`row_count`::
  The total number of rows in the result
`next_offset`::
  The offset to be used for the next page or -1 if there are no further
  pages.
`previous_offset`::
  The offset to be used for the previous page or -1 if this is the first
  page.
`current_offset`::
  The offset used for the current results.

*Example* +
Let’s look at a concrete example. We will return the third page of all
accounts with the industry `Media` using 10 as a page size and ordered
by name.

*_Example 3.6: Example get_list call_*


[source,php]
 1 $beanList = $accountBean->get_list(
 2                                 //Order by the accounts name
 3                                 'name',
 4                                 //Only accounts with industry 'Media'
 5                                 "accounts.industry = 'Media'",
 6                                 //Start with the 30th record (third page)
 7                                 30,
 8                                 //No limit - will default to max page size
 9                                 -1,
10                                 //10 items per page
11                                 10);



This will return:

*_Example 3.7: Example get_list results_*


[source,php]
 1 Array
 2 (
 3     //Snipped for brevity - the list of Account SugarBeans
 4     [list] => Array()
 5     //The total number of results
 6     [row_count] => 36
 7     //This is the last page so the next offset is -1
 8     [next_offset] => -1
 9     //Previous page offset
10     [previous_offset] => 20
11     //The offset used for these results
12     [current_offset] => 30
13 )



[discrete]
==== get_full_list

`get_list` is useful when you need paginated results. However if you are
just interested in getting a list of all matching beans you can use
`get_full_list`. The `get_full_list` method signature looks like this:

*_Example 3.8: get_full_list method signature_*
[source,php]
1 get_full_list(
2             $order_by = "",
3             $where = "",
4             $check_dates=false,
5             $show_deleted = 0

These arguments are identical to their usage in `get_list` the only
difference is the `$check_dates` argument. This is used to indicate
whether the date fields should be converted to their display values
(i.e. converted to the users date format).

*Results* +
The get_full_list call simply returns an array of the matching beans

*Example* +
Let’s rework our `get_list` example to get the full list of matching
accounts:

*_Example 3.9: Example get_full_list call_*


[source,php]
1 $beanList = $accountBean->get_full_list(
2                                 //Order by the accounts name
3                                 'name',
4                                 //Only accounts with industry 'Media'
5                                 "accounts.industry = 'Media'"
6                                 );



[discrete]
==== retrieve_by_string_fields

Sometimes you only want to retrieve one row but may not have the id of
the record. `retrieve_by_string_fields` allows retrieving a single
record based on matching string fields.

*_Example 3.10: retrieve_by_string_fields method signature_*


[source,php]
1 retrieve_by_string_fields(
2                           $fields_array,
3                           $encode=true,
4                           $deleted=true)



`$fields_array`::
  An array of field names to the desired value.
`$encode`::
  Whether or not the results should be HTML encoded.
`$deleted`::
  Whether or not to add the deleted filter.

{{% notice note %}}
Note here that,
confusingly, the deleted flag works differently to the other methods we
have looked at. It flags whether or not we should filter out deleted
results. So if true is passed then the deleted results will _not_ be
included.
{{% /notice %}}

*Results* +
retrieve_by_string_fields returns a single bean as it’s result or null
if there was no matching bean.

*Example* +
For example to retrieve the account with name `Tortoise Corp` and
account_type `Customer` we could use the following:

*_Example 3.11: Example retrieve_by_string_fields call_*


[source,php]
1 $beanList = $accountBean->retrieve_by_string_fields(
2                                 array(
3                                   'name' => 'Tortoise Corp',
4                                   'account_type' => 'Customer'
5                                 )
6                               );



== Accessing fields

If you have used one of the above methods we now have a bean record.
This bean represents the record that we have retrieved. We can access
the fields of that record by simply accessing properties on the bean
just like any other PHP object. Similarly we can use property access to
set the values of beans. Some examples are as follows:

*_Example 3.12: Accessing fields examples_*


[source,php]
 1 //Get the Name field on account bean
 2 $accountBean->name;
 3 
 4 //Get the Meeting start date
 5 $meetingBean->date_start;
 6 
 7 //Get a custom field on a case
 8 $caseBean->third_party_code_c;
 9 
10 //Set the name of a case
11 $caseBean->name = 'New Case name';
12 
13 //Set the billing address post code of an account
14 $accountBean->billing_address_postalcode = '12345';



When changes are made to a bean instance they are not immediately
persisted. We can save the changes to the database with a call to the
beans `save` method. Likewise a call to `save` on a brand new bean will
add that record to the database:

*_Example 3.13: Persisting bean changes_*


[source,php]
 1 //Get the Name field on account bean
 2 $accountBean->name = 'New account name';
 3 //Set the billing address post code of an account
 4 $accountBean->billing_address_postalcode = '12345';
 5 //Save both changes.
 6 $accountBean->save();
 7 
 8 //Create a new case (see the BeanFactory section)
 9 $caseBean = BeanFactory::newBean('Cases');
10 //Give it a name and save
11 $caseBean->name = 'New Case name';
12 $caseBean->save();


{{% notice info %}}
Whether to
save or update a bean is decided by checking the `id` field of the bean.
If `id` is set then SuiteCRM will attempt to perform an update. If there
is no `id` then one will be generated and a new record will be inserted
into the database. If for some reason you have supplied an `id` but the
record is new (perhaps in a custom import script) then you can set
`new_with_id` to true on the bean to let SuiteCRM know that this record
is new.
{{% /notice %}}

== Related beans

We have seen how to save single records but, in a CRM system,
relationships between records are as important as the records
themselves. For example an account may have a list of cases associated
with it, a contact will have an account that it falls under etc. We can
get and set relationships between beans using several methods.

[discrete]
==== get_linked_beans

The `get_linked_beans` method allows retrieving a list of related beans
for a given record.

*_Example 3.14: get_linked_beans method signature_*


[source,php]
1 get_linked_beans(
2                 $field_name,
3                 $bean_name,
4                 $sort_array = array(),
5                 $begin_index = 0,
6                 $end_index = -1,
7                 $deleted=0,
8                 $optional_where="");



`$field_name`::
  The link field name for this link. Note that this is not the same as
  the name of the relationship. If you are unsure of what this should be
  you can take a look into the cached vardefs of a module in
  `cache/modules/<TheModule>/<TheModule>Vardefs.php` for the link
  definition.
`$bean_name`::
  The name of the bean that we wish to retrieve.
`$sort_array`::
  This is a legacy parameter and is unused.
`$begin_index`::
  Skips the initial `$begin_index` results. Can be used to paginate.
`$end_index`::
  Return up to the `$end_index` result. Can be used to paginate.
`$deleted`::
  Controls whether deleted or non deleted records are shown. If true
  only deleted records will be returned. If false only non deleted
  records will be returned.
`$optional_where`::
  Allows filtering the results using an SQL WHERE clause. See the
  `get_list` method for more details.

*Results* +
`get_linked_beans` returns an array of the linked beans.

*_Example 3.15: Example get_linked_beans call_*


[source,php]
1 $accountBean->get_linked_beans(
2                 'contacts',
3                 'Contacts',
4                 array(),
5                 0,
6                 10,
7                 0,
8                 "contacts.primary_address_country = 'USA'");



[discrete]
==== relationships

In addition to the `get_linked_beans` call you can also load and access
the relationships more directly.

*Loading* +
Before accessing a relationship you must use the `load_relationship`
call to ensure it is available. This call takes the link name of the
relationship (not the name of the relationship). As mentioned previously
you can find the name of the link in
`cache/modules/<TheModule>/<TheModule>Vardefs.php` if you’re not sure.

*_Example 3.16: Loading a relationship_*


[source,php]
1 //Load the relationship
2 $accountBean->load_relationship('contacts');
3 //Can now call methods on the relationship object:
4 $contactIds = $accountBean->contacts->get();




*Methods*

`get` ::
Returns the ids of the related records in this relationship e.g for the
account - contacts relationship in the example above it will return the
list of ids for contacts associated with the account.

`getBeans` ::
Similar to `get` but returns an array of beans instead of just ids.

{{% notice warning %}}
`getBeans` will
load the full bean for each related record. This may cause poor
performance for relationships with a large number of beans.
{{% /notice %}}

`add` ::
Allows relating records to the current bean. `add` takes a single id or
bean or an array of ids or beans. If the bean is available this should
be used since it prevents reloading the bean. For example to add a
contact to the relationship in our example we can do the following:

*_Example 3.18: Adding a new contact to a relationship_*


[source,php]
 1 //Load the relationship
 2 $accountBean->load_relationship('contacts');
 3 
 4 //Create a new demo contact
 5 $contactBean = BeanFactory::newBean();
 6 $contactBean->first_name = 'Jim';
 7 $contactBean->last_name = 'Mackin';
 8 $contactBean->save();
 9 
10 //Link the bean to $accountBean
11 $accountBean->contacts->add($contactBean);




`delete` ::
`delete` allows unrelating beans. Counter-intuitively it accepts the ids
of both the bean and the related bean. For the related bean you should
pass the bean if it is available e.g when unrelating an account and
contact:

*_Example 3.19: Removing a new contact from a relationship_*


[source,php]
1 //Load the relationship
2 $accountBean->load_relationship('contacts');
3 
4 //Unlink the contact from the account - assumes $contactBean is a Contact SugarB\
5 ean
6 $accountBean->contacts->delete($accountBean->id, $contactBean);


{{% notice warning %}}
Be careful with the
delete method. Omitting the second argument will cause all relationships
for this link to be removed.
