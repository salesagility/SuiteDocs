= 19. Further Resources

Although this book has aimed to be a thorough resource, SuiteCRM is
large and feature rich. Therefore it is not possible to include all the
information you may require. Here are some extra resources for
developing with SuiteCRM.

== SuiteCRM Website

The SuiteCRM website http://suitecrm.com[SuiteCRM.com] has many
excellent resources including:

* https://suitecrm.com/forum/index[SuiteCRM forums] - Come and say hi!
* https://suitecrm.com/suitecrm/blog[SuiteCRM Blog]
* https://suitecrm.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page[SuiteCRM Wiki]

== External SuiteCRM Resources

https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM[SuiteCRM GitHub] - The SuiteCRM source code is hosted on GitHub. Here you can get bleeding edge code changes and even contribute code.

== SugarCRM Resources

SuiteCRM has strived to remain compatible with the SugarCRM community
edition and much of the documentation is still valid. The appropriate
version for SuiteCRM information is 6.5. Versions of documentation
higher than this (i.e. 7) will probably not be relevant.
