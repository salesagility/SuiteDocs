== Introduction
SuiteCRM API version 8 exposes a set of resources, to be consumed by clients who wish to harness the powerful CRM functionality provided by SuiteCRM. The API framework employs a Restful design to facilitate the http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/[JSON API 1.0] standard messages over HTTPS. It includes meta objects to provide functionality which is not yet defined in the JSON API 1.0 standard. The SuiteCRM API is secured by the OAuth 2 Server provided in SuiteCRM.
