18. Performance Tweaks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases the performance of SuiteCRM should not be an issue.
However in the case of large datasets or systems with many users you may
notice some performance degradation. These changes can help improve
performance.

[[leanpub-auto-server]]
Server
^^^^^^

The server that SuiteCRM runs on is, of course, very important when it
comes to the kind of performance you can expect. A full guide on server
setup is outside the scope of this book. However there are some things
you can do to ensure that you get the best performance out of SuiteCRM.

[[leanpub-auto-php]]
PHP
+++

Installing a PHP opcode cache will increase the performance of all PHP
files. These work by caching the compilation of PHP files resulting in
less work on each request. Furthermore SuiteCRM will use the caching API
of some PHP accelerators which will further increase performance. If you
are using Linux then http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php[APC] is the
usual choice. Windows users should check out
http://php.net/manual/en/book.wincache.php[WinCache].

[[leanpub-auto-mysql]]
MySQL
+++++

MySQL is notorious for having small default settings. Fully optimising
MySQL is outside the scope of this book (however checkout
http://mysqltuner.pl[mysqltuner.pl] for a helpful Perl script which will
provide setting recommendations - note that you should be careful when
running files from an unknown source). One small change that can make a
big difference is increasing the `innodb_buffer_pool_size`.

If you have migrated or imported a significant amount of data it is
possible that some tables will be fragmented. Running
`OPTIMIZE TABLE tablename` can increase performance.

[[leanpub-auto-indexes]]
Indexes
^^^^^^^

Adding indexes on the fields of modules can improve database
performance. The core modules usually have important fields indexed.
However if you have created a new module or added new, often searched
fields to a module then these fields may benefit from being indexed. See
the link:chap03.xhtml#vardefs-chapter[Vardef] chapter for adding
indexes.

[[leanpub-auto-config-changes]]
Config Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following are some config settings that can be used to improve
performance. Please note that in most cases you will have better
performance gains by first following the steps in previous sections.
These settings should be set in the config_override.php file. See the
chapter on the link:chap09.xhtml#config-chapter[Config] files for more
information.

....
$sugar_config['developerMode'] = false;
....

Unless you are actively developing on an instance developerMode should
be off. Otherwise each page request will cause cached files to be
reloaded.

....
$sugar_config['disable_count_query'] = true;
....

For systems with large amounts of data the count queries on subpanels
used for the pagination controls can become slow thereby causing the
page to be sluggish or outright slow to load. Disabling these queries
can improve performance dramatically on some pages.

....
$sugar_config['disable_vcr'] = true;
....

By default opening the detail view of a record from the list view will
also load the other records in the list to allow for easy moving through
records. If you do not use this feature, or, if loading the detail view
for some records has become slow, you can disable this feature.

....
$sugar_config['list_max_entries_per_page'] = '10';
....

The number of records shown in each page of the list view can be
decreased. This will result in a slight increase in performance on list
view pages.

....
$sugar_config['logger']['level'] = 'fatal';
....

Lowering the log level means that there will be less log messages to
write to disk on each request. This will slightly (very slightly)
increase performance.
