== Studio

The Studio tools allow you to customise the information shown in the
modules and how it is displayed. 

See the dedicated link:../studio[Studio guide] for more
information on how to use the Studio tools.

== Rename Modules

Use this panel to rename a *SuiteCRM* module. For example, you may wish 
to rename Accounts as Businesses.

image:RenameModules.png["Rename modules"]

Click on the module you wish to rename. Enter the new singular 
and plural labels for the module and click btn:[SAVE].

image:RenameModules2.png["Enter new singular and plural labels"]

The new module label will now appear on menus and headings throughout 
SuiteCRM.

== Module Builder

Use the Module Builder to create custom modules in SuiteCRM. The process of creating a custom module is as follows:

. Create a package to house the new module(s).
. Create a module using one of the following templates that SuiteCRM provides for you:
+
[cols = "20, 80", frame = "none", grid = "none"]
|===
| *Basic* | This template provides basic fields such as ID, Date Entered, and Created By. Use this template to create a module from scratch.
| *Company* | This template provides organization-specific fields such as Company Name, Industry, and Billing Address. Use this template to create a module that is similar to the Accounts module.
| *File* | This template provides document-specific fields such as File Name and Document Type. Use this template to create a module that is similar to the Documents module.
| *Issue* | This template provides case and bug-specific fields such as ID, Description, and Created By. Use this template to create a module that is similar to the Cases module or Bug Tracker module.
| *Person* | This template provides individual-specific fields such as salutation, title, name, address, and phone number. Use this template to create a module that is similar to the Contacts module or the Leads module.
| *Sale* | This template provides opportunity-specific fields such as Lead-Source and Probability. Use this template to create a module that is similar to the Opportunities module.
|===
Furthermore, you can configure the following options:
* *Importing:* Selecting this option to allow data import into the module.
* *Navigation Tab:* By default, this option is enabled to create a tab for the module on the top navigation bar. 
+
{{%notice note %}} If you want to hide modules temporarily, use <<display_modules_subpanels>> after deployment. Disable this option only for backend modules which will never be shown in the user interface. {{% /notice %}}

. Create new data fields. You can also rename default fields from the template.
. Customize page layouts for List View, Edit View, Detail View, Sub-panels, Search form, and SuiteCRM Dashlets.
. Create relationships between the new module and other modules. 
. Save the package and distribute it. 

{{%notice tip %}} Steps 3-5 are optional and can be done in Studio after deployment. {{% /notice %}}

=== Distribute a Package

You can choose one of the following options to distribute the package:

[cols = "20, 80", frame = "none", grid = "none"]

|===
| *Deploy* | This option is designed to install the custom module on your local SuiteCRM instance and make it available to users in your organization. After deployment, if needed, you can make further changes to the module in Module Builder and deploy it again to update the installed module. However, note that if you change a deployed custom module in Studio and then re-deploy it from Module Builder, all changes made prior in Studio will be lost. 
| *Publish* | This option is designed for distribution to specific users or customers. The system creates a zip file, which you can save on your local machine. You can then email it to one or more individuals who can use the Module Loader to upload the zip file into their SuiteCRM instance. After the module is installed through Studio, you can add or remove fields and make other changes to a published module.
| *Export* | This option is designed for distribution to developers. The system creates a zip file, which you can save on your local machine and email to other developers. Using the Module Loader, developers can install it on their SuiteCRM instance and customize it further in Module Builder if necessary. The package is visible only in Module Builder and, hence, only administrators can access it until it has been deployed.

== History Subpanel

image:HistorySubpanel.png["History subpanel settings"]

== Display Modules and Subpanels [[display_modules_subpanels]]

Control which modules and subpanels are visible in *SuiteCRM* by dragging
 and dropping modules or subpanels between the Displayed and Hidden columns.

This will show or hide modules in *SuiteCRM* for all users. Should you 
wish to control access to particular modules, this can be done using 
Role Management. See link:../roles-and-security-groups[Roles and Security Groups] 
for more information.

[cols = "40, 60", frame = "none", grid = "none"]
|===
|*Allow users to select modules to apppear in the navigation bar* |
Selecting this option allows users to customise which module tabs are 
visible from their User Settings.
|===

== Module Loader

Module Loader allows you to install and manage custom modules or plugins for your 
*SuiteCRM* instance. 

Custom module packages that have been created and modified in Module Builder will 
be displayed in Module Loader once they have been deployed.

For more information on producing packages that can be uploaded using Module Loader,
see the link:../../../developer/module-installer[Developer Guide] 

image:ModuleLoader6.png["Module Loader"]

Modules and packages that are already installed are listed in the top pane.
The lower panel is used to upload packages and will list any package that is
uploaded but not yet installed.

=== Upload and Install a Package

Click *Choose File* and browse for the package .zip file. Click btn:[UPLOAD]

Once uploaded, the package details will appear in the lower pane, including the
version number, a short description and whether or not the module can be uninstalled.

btn:[UNINSTALL] and btn:[DELETE PACKAGE] options will appear.

Click btn:[INSTALL] to install the module. 

image:ModuleLoader2.png["Module Loader"]

On the next screen, if there are no problems detected with the package and it is
ready to install you will be asked to click btn:[COMMIT] to complete the installation. 

If any errors occur during installation, they will be displayed here. 
Otherwise, clicking the *Display Log* link will detail the steps 
taken in the installation process.

image:ModuleLoader4.png["Module Loader"]

=== Uninstall a Package

For a package to be uninstallable it needs to be defined as uninstallable in the
 package manifest file. For more information regarding the manifest file 
see the link:../../../developer/module-installer[Developer Guide] 

Unistall a package by clicking the buttons next to the 
package name. 

As with the install procedure, you will be asked 
to confirm the uninstall on the next screen. If the package added any tables to your
database, you will be asked to if you wish to keep these, and any data within them, for 
example if you are replacing an older version of a module with a new one.

Click btn:[COMMIT] to uninstall the package.

If any errors occur during the uninstall they will be displayed here. 
Otherwise, clicking the *Display Log* link will detail the process.

Click btn:[BACK TO MODULE LOADER] to return to the Module Loader screen where
the newly installed package will appear in the list of installed extensions. 

An uninstalled module will be listed in the lower panel from where it can be 
re-installed or deleted.

== Configure Module Menu Filters

Use this section to configure the module menus on the top navigation bar.

image:ConfigureModuleMenuFilters.png["Configure Module Menu Filters"]

Drag modules from the list to the required menu, or delete an item by dragging it to 
the wastepaper bin icon.
Edit the menu name by clicking the pencil icon next to the module name. 
Delete a menu entirely by clicking the wastepaper bin icon next to the module name.

A new custom menu can be added by clicking btn:[ADD FILTER]
Add menu items by dragging and dropping as before

Any changes made will not take effect until you click btn:[SAVE & DEPLOY]

== Dropdown Editor

The Dropdown Editor shows all the dropdown lists currently installed on the system.

Click on the dropdown name to edit it. If you are unsure which dropdown you require, it can be 
easier to edit via Studio where you can find the dropdown by its field name.
See the link:../../administration-panel/studio/#_adding_a_dropdown_field[Studio guide] for full 
instructions on adding or editing a dropdown list.
