== AOS Settings

The Advanced OpenSales suite of modules allow you to
manage the Post-Opportunity Sales processes such as Quoting, Invoicing
and recurring Contracting.

You can customise the following settings within the AOS Settings:

* *Renewal Reminder Period*  This defines how many days before the
Contract End Date that a reminder call should be created.
* *Initial Invoice Number*  Allows users to set the initial invoice
number. For example 20001.
* *Initial Quote Number*  Allows users to set the initial quote number.
For example 456.
* *Enable Line Items Groups*  If selected then users will be able to
bundle line items into groups. If this is not selected then you will not
be able to use the AOS Group functionality. 
{{% notice note %}}
The Enable Line Item Groups setting should
be selected before using AOS.  It is difficult to migrate from/to groups
once Quotes/Invoices have been created.
{{% /notice %}}
* *Add Tax to Line Total*  If this is selected then the Tax will be added
into the Line Total on Line Items. If this is not the selected the Line
Total will not include Tax.

Once configured, click btn:[Save] to apply your AOS Settings.

== AOD Settings

Enable or disable *SuiteCRM*'s full text global search here.

The full text global search is powered by Zend Lucene search framework. 
The search works very similar to the standard global search, but provides the enhanced 
functionality of searching text in documents and other files, compared to the record-level 
search provided by the standard global search.

See the link:../../../user/introduction/user-interface/search[Search] documentation in the user
guide for more information on searching in *SuiteCRM*.

== AOP Settings

Here you can enable or disable the Advanced OpenPortal functionality, 
configure the Joomla URL, set the case distribution method, the 'from' name and email address and configure
the email templates used by the portal. 

See link:../../../user/advanced-modules/cases-with-portal[Cases with Portal] for more information
on AOP.

== Business Hours

Specify business working hours here. 

These settings will determine when workflows set to run 
'Only In The Scheduler' will run and will be used when "Consider Working days" is set on 
link:../../../user/core-modules/projects[Project] records.
