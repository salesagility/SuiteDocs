== Troubleshooting and Support

At SalesAgility we are advocates of Open Source. As such please do not
contact us directly via email or phone for SuiteCRM support. Instead
please use our support forum. By using the
https://suitecrm.com/forum/suite-forum[forum] the knowledge is shared
with everyone in the community. Our developers answer questions on the
forum daily but it also gives the other members of the community the
opportunity to contribute. If you would like SalesAgility to customise
SuiteCRM specifically for your needs, or to provide a hosted and
supported CRM solution, then please use our
https://salesagility.com/contact-us[contact form].

== Support Packages

There are various tiers of support service available for SuiteCRM. Ranging from 2 hours of support per month via tickets/phone up to 12 hours of support including email/ticket/phone support and access to experienced developer knowledge.
