===  pass:[<i class="fa fa-check fa-1x"></i>] Release Notes

This release includes an additional patch that you can install if you are having issue upgrading. This allows you apply the enhancements and fixes we have brought in recent release to the upgrade wizard, prior to you upgrading to hopefully resolve many issue we have seen in the community.
To apply the patch download it from the https://suitecrm.com/files/162/SuiteCRM-7.11/507/SuiteCRM_Upgrade_Patch.zip[here] and install via module loader, not via the upgrade wizard. Then proceed to upgrade as normal.

==== icon:clipboard[] Administrators Note 1/2
You may notice when installing SuiteCRM a new panel which allows for the configuration of different collations and type-sets. This is part of our progression towards resolving issues with special characters and emojis. Currently available sets include utf8 and utf8mb4.

==== icon:clipboard[] Administrators Note 2/2
Within this release, we have also resolved a few known issues with the upgrade process; however, they will unfortunately not take effect until the next upgrade cycle. Therefore it is vital that if you encounter any problems while installing that you review and follow the recommended process within the SuiteDocs upgrade debugging page which can be found https://community.suitecrm.com/t/debugging-steps-for-use-in-upgrade-version-prior-to-7-11-11-and-7-10-23/71273[here]

==== icon:wrench[] Potential breaking change with package container-interop
If you maintain a CRM utilising container-interop for API extension, you should note that this release may require some small changes to routing as seen below:

Instead of `Interop`
```
use Interop\Container\ContainerInterface;
```
Make use of `Psr`
```
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
```

===== Potential breaking change with Smarty

If you maintain a custom SuiteCRM theme, you should note that this release may require some small changes to your `.tpl` Smarty files. This is because of a legacy customization to Smarty that was removed when it was moved to inclusion via Composer.

The only breaking change will be if you've used the `theme_template` attribute for any Smarty ``include``s. You'll need to remove the `theme_template` attribute and change the file attribute to use the full path:

[source,html]
----
{* before *}
{ include file="_head.tpl" theme_template=true }

{* after *}
{ include file="themes/SuiteP/tpls/_head.tpl" }
----

Plugin files are still usable in the same way as before – at `./include/Smarty/plugins/` – and can be ``require``d explicitly. Custom plugins should still go in `./custom/include/Smarty/plugins/`. It should be noted that all other files in `./include/Smarty` have been replaced by empty files to prevent errors in case users were `require`ing the files. They're deprecated, and requires referencing them can be safely removed. Smarty's internal files will be autoloaded by Composer by default.

== 7.10 Release Candidate 2

=== Assets

* https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/archive/v7.10-RC-2.zip[*Source code* (zip)]
* https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/archive/v7.10-RC-2.tar.gz[*Source code* (tar.gz)]

=== Release Notes

In order to facilitate European GDPR compliance, SuiteCRM 7.10 introduces two Opt-In settings,
Opt-In and Confirmed-Opt-In.

1. Opt In is used to indicate that a Contact, Lead or Target has opted in to receive marketing communications.

2. Confirmed Opt In further requires users to confirm their opt-in status by clicking a link sent to them
via email. This email can be configured to send automa cally (e.g. on submission of a Web-To-Person form) or manually,
and the template used to send this email can be customised.

*You can read more about this new feature link:/user/modules/confirmed-opt-in-settings/[here].*

Download https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/releases/tag/v7.9.13[here] from the SuiteCRM GitHub Repository
or https://suitecrm.com/download[visit the official website] to find the appropriate upgrade.

We have also updated our Security Process asking the community to send their security issues directly to us
via email security@suitecrm.com.
