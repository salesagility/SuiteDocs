SuiteCRM's Elasticsearch integration ships with two useful command line tools powered by https://robo.li/[_Robo_].

These two commands allow to perform indexing and searches from the command line, making debug and integration
with external tools easier.

{{% notice note %}}
These commands require a working connection to the database, if you are running SuiteCRM behind Docker or a VM,
please execute them from a shell on the same host as the SuiteCRM web server.
