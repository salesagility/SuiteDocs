In order to make the troubleshooting process easier for the Elasticsearch extension, a separate file is used to offer
very verbose and dedicated logging: `search_index.log`. This is mostly because the indexing procedures are run in the
background, where they are hard to debug. Logging calls get redirected to the standard logging, filtered with the
configured logging level.

In addition to checking the logs, you could try running the search or the indexing from the command line using the
link:../command-line-tools[command line tools]. Given the verbosity of the console output, this should surely help
narrowing down the issue.

Finally, enabling the *developer mode* in the admin settings, will provide a clear exception page if the error happens
at some point during the search process.
