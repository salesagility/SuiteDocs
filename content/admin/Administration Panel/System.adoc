The Upgrade Wizard provides a quick and simple way to upgrade your SuiteCRM application.
Download the required https://suitecrm.com/upgrade-suitecrm/[upgrade package] and check your 
link:../../compatibility-matrix/[system compatibility] before running
the wizard.

See link:../../installation-guide/using-the-upgrade-wizard/[Using the Upgrade Wizard] for full instructions 
on upgrading.

== Currencies

Use this section to add a currency to *SuiteCRM*. The default currency can be set in the <<Locale>> section.

Entering the ISO 4217 code for the currency will autofill the Currency Name and Currency Symbol fields.

You must also specify a currency conversion rate before saving the new currency settings.

image:Currencies.png[title = "Add Currency"]

== Backups

The *SuiteCRM* application files can be backed up using this tool. Please note that you should also 
perform regular backups of your database - see the vendor's documentation for details on how to do this.

== Languages

Download language packs for *SuiteCRM* https://crowdin.com/project/suitecrmtranslations[here].

== Repair

Selecting Repair from the System Settings panel displays a wide range of repair options
for SuiteCRM which will run automatically when the link is clicked. *SuiteCRM* may direct you to 
run particular Repair commands, for example following an upgrade using the <<Upgrade Wizard>>.

Quick Repair and Rebuild is the most often used command here, and will be required after
installing a new module via Module Loader for example, or to display changes to code 
during development when <<Advanced Settings, Developer Mode>> is not set.

When running a Quick Repair and Rebuild, be sure to scroll to the bottom of the page to view any
new SQL code which may need to be executed to ensure that your database tables are correctly
synced with any changes that have been made.

== Global Search

The Global Search functionality is used to search for records using the search bar on the main 
navigation menu.
Add or remove modules from the Global Search here.

See the User Interface guide to the link:../../user/introduction/user-interface[global search] 
for more information.

== Themes

From 7.9 onwards, only the SuiteP theme is available. For earlier versions, you can set the default theme
and which other themes are available for users to select here.

image:AdminThemes.png[title = "AdminThemes"]

From 7.10 onwards, there is a choice of theme colours for SuiteP which can be set from the User profile.


== Scheduler

SuiteCRM uses a number of Scheduler jobs running at scheduled times, supporting functionality such as search indexing, 
workflows, email notifications, database maintenance and sending campaign emails.

image:AdminScheduler.png[title = "Scheduler"]


=== Setting up the Scheduler

Scheduler jobs need to be manually enabled. This is done by running a script called cron.php 
every minute. This, in turn, manages all SuiteCRM jobs according to their proper schedules. 

In Windows this is setup using Task Scheduler, and in Linux and iOS, it is setup in crontab. Detailed instructions 
for your system will be displayed during installation and can also be found on the Schedulers page, under the list
of scheduled jobs. 

See link:../../../blog/scheduler-jobs/[Scheduler Jobs in SuiteCRM in Linux - the Definitive Guide]
 for an in-depth guide to setting up and managing scheduled jobs in Linux.

=== Configuring Scheduled Jobs

Click on a scheduled job to view settings

image:AdminScheduledTask.png[title = "Scheduled Task"]

In edit mode, you can set the job status (only Active jobs will run) and configure the interval at which the job runs
as well as the start time.
Unckecking the the 'Advanced Options' box will show a more user-friendly way to set the job interval if you are not 
familiar with the crontab notation. Re-checking Advanced Options will let you set the initial start time. 

image:AdminEditScheduledTask.png[title = "Edit Scheduled Task"]


== Activity Streams

By default the Activity Stream dashlet displays recent updates for the Opportunities, Contacts, Leads and Cases modules. 

The Activity Stream admin panel allows you to configure what is displayed on the activity feed and which features are available to users.

image:SystemActivityStreams.png[title = "Configure Activity Stream"]

[cols = "40, 60", frame = "none", grid = "none"]
|===
|*Enable MyActivity Stream Dashlet:*|Enables/disables the Activity Stream dashlet for all users
|*Activate Feeds For:*|Select the modules to display activity for
|*Activate User Feed:*|Allows users to enter messages in the status update field for broadcast to all users
