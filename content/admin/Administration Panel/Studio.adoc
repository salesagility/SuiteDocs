==== Editing A Field

Click on a field to view the field's properties. These can be edited in the same way as detailed 
above for adding a new field.

==== Deleting A Field

Only fields that have been created in Studio can be deleted via Studio. Core fields cannot be deleted.

Select the field you wish to delete and click btn:[DELETE] A warning message will appear asking you to 
confirm the deletion as both the field and any data related to the custom field will be deleted from the 
database and the field will no longer appear on any module views.

=== Relationships

A relationship represents a two-way link between two modules. Selecting the Relationships component 
displays all the relationships between the currently selected module
and other deployed modules.

image:StudioRelationships.png["studio - module relationships"]

Click on a relationship to view the relationship properties. 

Click btn:[ADD RELATIONSHIP] to add a new relationship for the selected module.

image:StudioAddRelationship.png["studio - add relationship"]

The *Primary Module* will be set to the currently selected module. 

Specify the relationship type:

*One to One*

With a One-to-One relationship, each record in the primary module may only have one related record in 
the related module, and vice versa. This type of relationship will add a relate field to both 
modules' records.

*One to Many*

With a One-To-Many relationship, records in the primary module may be related to one or more records 
in the related module, but each related module record is only related to one primary module record.
This will add a relate field to the related module's records, but the primary module will display 
a subpanel where more than one related module records can be added.

*Many to Many*

With a Many-To-Many relationship, records in the primary module can be related to one or more records 
in the related module, and vice versa. Each module's records will contain a subpanel for the related records.

Select the *Related Module* from the dropdown list.

Where there are subpanels, subpanel views for the module(s) can be selected. 

Click btn:[SAVE AND DEPLOY] to save the relationship.

=== Layouts

Layouts can be edited in Studio to customise the module views shown to users.

Fields can be added to the view either as a new row in an existing panel (section),
or by adding a new panel.
