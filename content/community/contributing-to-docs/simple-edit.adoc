== Your first simple edit

In order to contribute to the Documentation efforts, you can edit pages directly on GitHub 
which is the repository of our content.

{{% notice info %}}
You need a https://github.com/join[Github user account^] to edit pages on the SuiteCRM Documentation Site. If you don't have one yet, you will be given the opportunity to create one during this process.

=== 1. Navigate to the place you want to edit

Simply use your browser to go to the page you want to edit. You can use the menus and search feature to facilitate this.

=== 2. Click to "Edit this page"

Every page on the site has an "Edit this Page" link near the top.

=== 3. Make your changes

You are taken to GitHub where a text editor will allow you to edit the source code of the file. 
The format used is called https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[Asciidoc^], and looks pretty much like plain text. 

If you're just editing text, don't bother learning the format, just go ahead and edit it!

In this example, we inserted the sentence highlighted in yellow, and we click the green button 
at the bottom that is labeled btn:[Propose File Change].

=== 4. Propose your changes by creating a Pull Request

You could make additional changes to other files before proposing your change to the site maintainers. 
But for our first simple edit we'll do it immediately.

In this screen, you can improve the title of your proposal, add descriptive comments, and review your changes.  
But that is all optional - all you _really_ have to do is press a green button again, this time it's labeled btn:[Create pull request].

=== That's it, you're done!

Your proposed change is now up for evaluation by the members of the Community in charge of the 
SuiteCRM Documentation site. They will receive an e-mail notification as soon as you finish your proposal.

You can check the status of every Pull Request, and participate in any discussion about them by visiting https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteDocs/pulls[this list^].

Every small contribution matters! Thanks for helping out. 

Of course, this was just a starter's guide. If you're ready to use more Asciidoc features 
and really leverage all the power of Github, make sure you check out other tutorials.
