Check out awaiting pull requests on our SuiteCRM repo https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/pulls[here].

Select a pull request that is ready to test e.g. https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/pull/6612

Obtain the author's repo. e.g. https://github.com/jack7anderson7/SuiteCRM
and the branch specific to the PR e.g. issue-6611

{{% notice tip %}}
You can find the user's repo by clicking on their username on the PR or you
could usually use the URL https://github.com/{username}/SuiteCRM replacing
{username} with the author's username.
{{% /notice %}}

Now we have these essential pieces of information we can pull down the code to test.
Create a new branch using the base of the PR e.g. hotfix, hotfix-7.10.x or develop
within your SuiteCRM fork directory.
Name the new branch uniquely if you want to test alot of PRs e.g. testing6611

`cd /name/of/your/forked/instance` +
`git checkout -b testing6614 hotfix`

Let's pull down the author's branch into our new test branch using the author's repo
and branch name we obtained earlier.
e.g. git pull {author's repo} {author's branch}

`git pull https://github.com/jack7anderson7/SuiteCRM.git issue-6611`

From the above command you will see the files that have been pulled down.

That's it! You are ready to test a pull request.
Remember to follow the PR's "How to Test This" section or use the related Bug on how to confirm
the PR resolves the issue.

If the PR resolves the issue and there are no outstanding tasks then leave
a comment with the text "Assessed :+1:"
