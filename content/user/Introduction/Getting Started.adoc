== Logging Into SuiteCRM

SuiteCRM allows users to log in using your Username and Password,
provided to you by the System Administrator.

Before logging into SuiteCRM, you can select the language you wish to
use. There are many default languages for SuiteCRM and there are also
additional language packs available for other languages around the
world.

Once you have chosen your language and have entered your user
credentials, you will be able to click the Login button to access the
CRM.

== Forgotten Password

If you forget your CRM password and cannot access your CRM user account,
you can use the 'Forgotten Password' feature to re-send your password to
the email address associated to your user account. Clicking the 'Forgot
Password?' link on the login form will display the forgotten password
form.

== Summary

In this chapter we have demonstrated how to access SuiteCRM using the
login form. We have also established how to use the forgotten password
functionality to retrieve a users password in the event of the password
being lost or forgotten.

In the next chapter we will cover the User Wizard, which allows you to
set your preferences when using SuiteCRM.
