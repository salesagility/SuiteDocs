= Advanced Open Workflow

Advanced OpenWorkflow (AOW) is a module for SuiteCRM, allowing users to
create custom workflow processes. This module allows users to trigger
various system actions based on conditions from any SuiteCRM module.

== Creating a Workflow Process

You can create workflow processes by navigating to the 'WorkFlow' module
within SuiteCRM. Click the 'Create WorkFlow' button within the action
bar to start creating the process. The first panel allows users to set
up the workflow process.

image:106Creating_a_workflow.png[title="Creating a Workflow"]

This allows you to specify the following:

* *Name* – The name of the process.
* *Assigned To* - The assigned user of the workflow process.
* *WorkFlow Module* – A drop down list of all the modules found within the
SuiteCRM instance. This is the module the workflow is run against. For
example, When an Account is created/edited.
* *Status* – Active or Inactive. Only active processes will run.
* *Run* – Always, On Save or On Scheduler.
* *Run On* – All Records, Modified Records or New Records.
* *Repeated Runs* – If checked, the process will continue to run over and
over. Ideally this should only be checked if one of the specified
Actions negates (or will lead to the negation) of one of the specified
Conditions.
* *Description* – A description of the process.

== Conditions

[discrete]
==== Adding Conditions

Once set up, you can add conditions to a workflow process using the
conditions panel. This allows users to specify the criteria that should
trigger the workflow actions.

image:107Adding_conditions.png[title="Add Condition"]

To add a Condition Line you must click the 'Add Condition' button.

{{% notice note %}}
You must select your WorkFlow Module on the first panel before
adding a Condition Line.
{{% /notice %}}

image:206Add_condition.png[title="Add Condition"]

You can have an unlimited amount of Condition Lines. To add another line
click the 'Add Condition' button again and it will appear. On the line
you will have four fields; Field, Operator, Type and Value.

[discrete]
==== Field and Operator

Field is a drop down which automatically populates with all the fields
found in the WorkFlow Module.

image:109Field_box.png[title="Field Box"]

The Field selected will determine the options available for Operator and
Type. If the field type is not a number or date then the operators
available will be 'Equal To' or 'Not Equal To'. For number and date
fields you can also choose from additional logical operators; 'Less
Than', 'Greater Than', 'Less Than or Equal To' or 'Greater Than or Equal
To'.

image:110Operator_box.png[title="Operator Box"]

[discrete]
==== Condition Types

You can specify workflow processes to trigger on different condition
types. These are as follows:

* *Value* – This is used to directly compare the Field to a value. The value
type offered is dynamic to the field type of the Field selected. For
example, if the field type is a drop down then the value field type will
be the same drop down list.

image:111Value_condition.png[title="Value"]

* *Field* – This is used to action a workflow process when one field is
compared to another field in the record.

image:112Field_condition.png[title="Field"]

* *Multiple* – This can be selected if the Field is a drop down/multiselect.
This allows users to specify multiple values to action the workflow
from.

image:113Multiple_condition.png[title="Multiple"]

* *Date* – This allows you to specify the workflow to occur after/before an
amount of time from either another date field or 'Now'. For example,
when the start date of a call is 'Now + 10 minutes'. This can only be
used when the Field is a date field. The amount of time before or after
the date can be specified in Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks or Months.

image:114Date_condition.png[title="Date"]

[discrete]
==== Removing Conditions

You can remove Condition Lines by clicking the '-' button on the left
hand side of the condition.

image:115Removing_conditions.png[title="Removing COnditions"]

== Actions

[discrete]
==== Adding Actions

Actions are defined in the third panel. These specify what events should
occur when the conditions have been met. You can add an Action by
clicking the 'Add Action' button.

image:116Adding_actions.png[title="Add Action"]

This will cause the Action Line to appear.

image:207Action_line.png[title="Action Line"]

From the Action Line you can Select Action and give it a Name. The
actions available are; 'Create Record', 'Modify Record' and 'Send
Email'. You can specify an unlimited amount of actions for each workflow
process.

[discrete]
==== Create Record

If you select 'Create Record' you will be prompted to select a Record
Type. This is the module type of the record you are looking to create.

image:208Create_record.png[title="Create Record"]

Once selected you can add fields or relationships to this record using
the 'Add Field' and 'Add Relationship' buttons.

image:209Add_field-relationship1.png[title="Add Field/Relationship"]

When Adding fields the first drop down in the line will populate with
all the fields from that module. The second drop down allows you to
specify how the value for that field is going to be derived. For most
cases the options are as follows:

* *Value* – This will allow you to input the value directly using the same
field type as the field selected.
* *Field* – This will make the field the same value as a field found in
the WorkFlow Module.
* *Date* – Only selectable if the field is a date field. This will allow
you to specify the value as an amount of time after/before another date
field or 'Now'.

image:210Adding_fields.png[title="Adding Fields"]

Selecting the 'Assigned-To' field also gives you more options. As well
as by value and field you can assign a user by:

* *Round Robin* – This will select each user in turn.
* *Least Busy* – This will select you with the least amount of records
assigned to you for that module.
* *Random* – This will select a random user.

For each of the above options you can choose if you want you to be
selected from all users or users from a specific role. If you have the
SecuritySuite module installed you can additionally choose if you want
you to be selected from all users from a particular Security Group or
all users from a particular security group with a particular role.

image:121Assigned_field.png[title="Assigned Field"]

When adding relationships you must select the related module from the
drop down list then select the record that the new record should be
related to.

image:212Add_relationship.png[title="Add Relationship"]

{{% notice note %}}
You must selected the related module using the arrow button – The
auto completion on the text field is not currently developed.
{{% /notice %}}

[discrete]
==== Modify Record

This provides the same functionality as 'Create Record' but instead of
creating a new record you are modifying the record which met the
conditions of the workflow process. With this action you can modify any
field found within the record or you can add a relationship to another
record. This is completed in the same way as 'Create Record' except you
are not required to specify the Record Type.

[discrete]
==== Send Email

The 'Send Email' action allows users to create workflow processes which
will send an email based on an template to individuals. Using this
action there are four different types of recipient.

* *Email* – This will send an email to a specific email address. You must
specify the email address and the email template.

image:213Send_email_to.png[title="Send Email"]

Record Email – This will send an email to the primary email address
specified on the record which actioned the workflow process. This can
only be used if the record has an email field such as Accounts and
Contacts. For this option you only need to specify the template.

image:image127.png[title="Record Email"]

* *User* – This will send the email to a specified Users email address. You
must specify the recipient user and the template of the email.

image:214Send_email_to_user.png[title="User"]

* *Related Field* – This will send an email to the primary email address
specified on a related modules record. In this case you must specify the
related module (From a drop down list) and the email template.

image:215Email_related_field.png[title="Related Field"]

=== Calculate Fields

If you select 'Calculate Fields' from the Action dropdown the Calculate
Fields user interface will be loaded after a second and looks like the
picture below.

image:216Calculate_fields.png[title="Calculate Fields"]

[discrete]
===== Calculate Fields - Adding parameters

It is possible to add parameters to the formulas by using the dropdown
in the Parameters section of the Calculate Fields’s user interface. The
dropdown contains all of the (basic and custom) fields which belongs to
the module selected in the basic fields section.

To add a parameter, select the field from the dropdown and click on the
Add parameter button. After this action, a new line appears in the
parameter table with the name of the field and the given identifier.

For some fields (dropdowns and multi-selects) an additional dropdown
shown up where the user can select if the raw or the formatted value
should be used in Calculated Fields. The raw format means the value
which is stored in the database and the formatted value means the label
for that database value.

To remove a parameter from the table, simply click on the minus button
in the row of the parameter. Be aware, that if you remove a parameter,
all of the identifiers are recalculated, so the identifiers could change
for fields!

image:217Add_parameter.png[title="Adding Parameters"]

The identifier is used to reference this field when the user creates the
formula. For example all appearances of the \{P0} identifier will be
replaced with the Account’s name in the formula. All parameters are like
\{Px} where x is the sequential order of the parameter. The amount of
the parameters is not limited.

[discrete]
===== Calculate Fields - Adding relation parameters

Relation parameters are very similar to the regular parameters, the only
difference is that the user first selects an entity which is in a
one-to-one or one-to-many relationship with the actual entity.

To add a relation parameter, select the relation first, and then select
the field from the connected entity and push the Add relation parameter
button. After this action, a new line appears in the relation parameter
table with the name of the relationship, the name of the field and the
given identifier.

As for parameters for some relation parameter fields (dropdowns and
multi-selects) an additional dropdown shown up where the user can select
if the raw or the formatted value should be used in Calculate Fields.

To remove a relation parameter from the table, simply click on the minus
button in the row of the relation parameter. Be aware, that if you
remove a relation parameter, all of the identifiers are recalculated, so
the identifiers could change for fields!

image:128Adding_relation_parameter.png[title="Relation Parameters"]

The identifier is used to reference this field when the user creates the
formula. For example all appearances of the \{R0} identifier will be
replaced with the creator user‘s username in the formula. All relation
parameters are like \{Rx} where x is the sequential order of the
relation parameter. The amount of the relation parameters is not
limited.

[discrete]
===== Calculate Fields - Creating formula for a field

In the Formulas part of the user interface the user can add formulas for
fields of the actual entity.

To add a formula, select a field from the dropdown first and then push
the Add formula button. After this action, a new line appears in the
formula table with the name of the field and with the place for the
formula.

To remove a formula from the table, simply click on the minus button in
the row of the formula.

image:129Add_formula.png[title="Add Formula"]

The formula is a textbox where the user can write the formulas. The
module evaluates the formula on the given time (on save, on scheduler
run or both) and fills the selected field with the evaluated value.

The formula can contain any text (with full UTF-8 support), but only the
function parts (functions with parameters between ‘\{‘ and ‘}’) are
evaluated. For example and with the parameters added in the previous
sections, if we fill the formula like: Account \{P0} created by user
name \{R0}, then the description field will have the following value
after save: Account My Account created by user name MyUser (implying the
account’s name is My Account and the creator user’s username is MyUser).

The Calculate Fields has many built-in functions which allows the user
to build complex formulas to achieve various goals. These functions are
described in the next section.

[discrete]
===== Calculate Fields - Usable functions

As it is mentioned above, all of the functions are wrapped between ‘\{‘
and ‘}’ signs, and they look like \{functionName(parameter1; parameter2;
…)}. The count of the parameters are different for the different
functions. The module evaluates the functions and changes them with
their result in the formula.

The functions can be embedded into each other (using a result of a
function as a parameter for another function) like in this example:

 {power({subtract({divide({add({multiply(10; 2)}; 12)}; 8)}; 1)}; 2)}

This function is the formalised look of the following mathematical
expression:

 ((((10 * 2) + 12) / 8) – 1)2 

The functions are divided to six groups. These groups are described in
the next section of the document.

==== Logical Functions

Logical functions are returning true or false in the form of 1 and 0 so
checkboxes typed fields can be filled with these functions. They can be
also used as the logical condition for the ifThenElse function.

==== Control Functions

There is only one control function implemented in Calculate Fields so
far, but this function ensures that the user can write very complex
formulas with conditions. Since the functions can be embedded in each
other, the user can write junctions with many branches.

===== ifThenElse

[cols="30,50", width="80%"]

|*Example call* |\{ifThenElse(\{equal(1; 1)}; 1 equals 1; 1 not equals 1)}
returns 1 equals 1
|=======================================================================

==== Counters

There are several counters implemented in Calculate Fields which can be
used in various scenarios.

The counters sorted into two groups:

1.  *Global counters:* Counters which are incremented every time an
affected formula is evaluated
2.  *Daily counters:* Counters which resets every day. (Starting from 1)

In this chapter we assume that the counters current value is 4, so the
incremented value will be 5 with the given format.

==== Example - Calculate monthly fee for an opportunity

===== Use Case

The user would like to calculate a monthly fee of an opportunity to a
custom field by dividing the amount of the opportunity by the duration.

===== Setup

Our opportunities module has a dropdown field called Duration with
values: (database value in brackets) 6 months [6], 1 year [12], 2 years
[24]. There is also a currency field called Monthly.

===== Workflow

Go to WorkFlow module and create a new WorkFlow. Set the base options
like the following:

[cols=",", width="50%"]
|=====================================================
|*Name:* as you wish |*WorkFlow Module:* Opportunities
|*Status:* Active |*Run:* Only on save
|*Run on:* All records |*Repeated runs:* checked
|=====================================================

image:130Example_workflow.png[title="Example Workflow"]

We do not create any conditions, since we would like the WorkFlow to run
on all opportunities.

Now, add an action and select Calculate Fields from the dropdown.

Then, add two fields from Opportunities as parameters. First, select
Opportunity amount (amount) and add it as a parameter (it will be \{P0})
then select Duration and the raw value option from the data type
dropdown and add it as parameter two (it will be \{P1}). There is no
need to add any relational parameters for this formula.

Now, add a formula for the monthly field and fill the textbox with the
following formula:

 {divide({P0}; {P1})}

So the whole action should look like this:

image:ExampleCF_updated1.png[title="Example WorkFlow"]

Save the WorkFlow and create a new Opportunity:

image:ExampleCF_orig2.png[title="Example WorkFlow"]

As you can see, we did not even add the monthly field to the EditView,
because we don’t want to force the user to make calculations. Save the
Opportunity and check the results on the DetailView:

== Process Audit

Advanced OpenWorkflow allows users to audit your processes. In the
Detail View of each WorkFlow record there is a sub-panel called
'Processed Flows'.

image:image132.png[title="Process Audit"]

This lists all the workflow processes which have been actioned including
details on the record which actioned the flow, its status and the date
it was created.

image:image133.png[title="Process Audit"]

You can view this information at a higher level by clicking the 'View
Process Audit' button within the module action bar. This will show all
the processes that have run for all the WorkFlow records.
