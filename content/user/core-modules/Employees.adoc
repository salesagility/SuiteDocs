This module is used to manage information about employees in your organization.

All users added to the system through the Administrator panel are automatically registered in it and as employees.

Employees originally added to the system through the module *Employees*:
they will be displayed in the list of employees, but they cannot register
in the system until the necessary login and password are assigned to them.
Thus, in this module the entire list of employees of your organization can be presented,
including employees who are not employed in SuiteCRM.

 to return to the list of employees without saving the entered information.
