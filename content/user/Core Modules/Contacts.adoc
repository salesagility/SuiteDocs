= Contacts

In SuiteCRM a Contact is an individual who is typically associated with
an Account (organisation) or Opportunity (qualified prospect). For
example if Techco is the Account, then John Smith, Sales Manager of
Techco is the Contact. This module holds all information relating to
these individuals and also provides a vantage point for any history
relating to a Contact record, for example if they were involved in a
Meeting, raised a Case or sent an Email.

== Contacts Actions

You can access the Contacts actions from the Contacts module menu drop
down or via the Sidebar. The Contacts actions are as follows:

* *Create Contact* – A new form is opened in Edit View to allow you to
create a new Contact record.
* *View Contacts* – Redirects you to the List View for the Contacts
module. This allows you to search and list Contact records.
* *Import Contacts* – Redirects you to the Import Wizard for the Contacts
module. For more information, see link:/user/introduction/user-interface/#_importing_records[Importing Records].
