= Leads

In SuiteCRM a Lead is an unqualified contact usually generated from some
form of marketing related event, for example it could be a person that
has filled out a form on your website or someone that you met at a trade
show and you are not sure yet if they have buying authority. Once a Lead
is qualified and converted then it can be split into three parts; a
Contact once you have established 'Who' it is, an Account when you know
'Where' they work and an Opportunity once it is known 'What' they might
buy.

== Leads Actions

You can access the Leads actions from the Leads module menu drop down or
via the Sidebar. The Leads actions are as follows:

* *Create Lead* – A new form is opened in Edit View to allow you to create
a new Account record.
* *View Leads* – Redirects you to the List View for the Leads module. This
allows you to search and list Lead records.
* *Import Leads* – Redirects you to the Import Wizard for the Leads
module. For more information, see link:/user/introduction/user-interface/#_importing_records[Importing Records].

== Converting a Lead

Once enough information is gathered about a Lead, then the Lead can be
progressed to the next Sales stage and the Lead can be converted into a
Contact, Account and Opportunity. The way in which a Lead is converted
depends on how the System Administrator has set up SuiteCRM. To convert
a Lead with the default SuiteCRM setup you have to click on an
individual Lead record to access the Detail View of the Lead and click
on the arrow next to the Other button, then click on *'Convert Lead'* from
the drop-down menu shown in the image below:

By deselecting the checkbox next to 'Create Contact' you will be able to
associate the Lead to an existing Contact. However, in most cases when
converting a Lead there will be no existing Contact. Make sure the
Create Contact checkbox is selected. Some of the fields will
automatically be populated using the Lead information. Fill out the
remaining relevant fields and move to the next Stage below:

=== Convert Lead to Account
