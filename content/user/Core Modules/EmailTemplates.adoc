== Overview

Email templates are used to send standardised responses and notifications via email. Adding variables allows you to personalise these communications and include additional relevant information such as order details.

From *SuiteCRM* 7.9.x onwards, email templates can be viewed, edited and created from the *Email Templates* module which can be found on the *ALL* menu. Alternatively, templates can be created by the user directly from the workflow and campaigns modules.

{{% notice tip %}}The template editor used for creating and editing email templates can be selected in the link:../../modules/email-settings/#_user_profile_email_settings[user profile email settings]. The default setting (Mozaik) is shown in the following screen shots. {{% /notice %}}

There are a number of default *System* templates which are created on install. These are used to send out system notifications such as new passwords or case updates. These can be viewed and edited here alongside user-generated templates. Templates created here can also be used in link:../../advanced-modules/advanced-open-workflow[Workflows] and link:../campaigns[Campaigns] for example, as well as for system notifications.

Click on a template name to view the template. 

To edit an existing template, either open the template and select *Edit* from the *Actions* menu, or click the pencil icon to the left of the template name. Once in *Edit* mode, the template can be edited in the same way as <<Creating a template, creating a template>>, below.

== Creating an Email Template

Select *Create Email Template* from the sidebar. This *Create* view will also appear if you choose to create a template from within another module such as link:../advanced-open-workflow[Workflows], for example. 

Select *Email*, *Campaign* or *System* depending on the use for the template. *System* templates are used to send system generated notifications such as case updates.
