= Getting Started

== Overview
=== SuiteCRM Analytics User Console
The SuiteCRM User Console allows end users to run reports and dashboards that have been packaged with the default installation or created by the solution developers using the SuiteCRM Analytics client tools

== Log In
Get started with SuiteCRM Analytics by following these steps to login:

1. Launch a Web browser and enter the URL of the SuiteCRM Analytics server.
This will typically be *http://localhost:8080/suitecrmanalytics* if the server is running on your own machine

2. The page loads an introductory screen with a *Login* section.

3. Enter your user name and password and click *Login*.

image:IMAGE1.png[title="Log In"]

The default login details for the admin user are below:

Username: *admin*

Password: *password*

Once you have successfully logged in you will be welcomed by the default homepage of the SuiteCRM Analytics User Console

== About SuiteCRM Analytics Perspectives
The SuiteCRM Analytics User Console interface uses perspectives to extend your ability to work on different tasks at any given time.
By default the User Console has the *Home*, *Browse*, *Opened*, *Schedules* and *Administration* perspectives.

=== Home
The first thing you see after you log into the *SuiteCRM Analytics User Console* is the *Home* perspective, which serves as the portal for you to access tools and features.
*Home* contains easy access buttons so that you can *Browse Files*, *Create New* dashboards, view *Documentation*, and quickly open recently viewed or favorite files.

== Managing Users & Roles
This section provides an overview of the default assignments for users and roles, the permissions included, and the management of users and roles in the SuiteCRM Analytics User Console.
You must login to the User Console as an administrator (or be assigned to a role that has Administer Security permission) to manage users and roles for SuiteCRM Analytics Security.

Here is how you can manage users:

* Add Users
* Change User Passwords
* Delete Users
* Assign Users to Roles

Here is how you can manage roles:

* Add Roles
* Assign Permissions to Roles
* Delete Roles
* Assign Roles to Users

You can control users and roles in the User Console with a point-and-click user interface.
The *Users & Roles* page allows you to switch between user and role settings.
You can add, delete, and edit users and roles from this page.

*Note*: Access to files or folders can also be refined using the *Browse Files* perspective in the *User Console*.
Each file or folder can use the default permissions or permissions can be customized for specific users and roles.

=== Sample Users, Default Roles, and Permissions
By viewing the sample user and default role examples you can get ideas about ways to define actual users and specific roles.

1. *Login* to the User Console. Click *Home > Administration*.
The Administration perspective opens the *Users & Roles* page with the *Manage Users* tab selected.

2. Highlight a user in the users list to display which roles are available for that user, as well as which role is currently defined for that user.

3. Select the *Manage Roles* tab to display the *Operation Permissions* for the user's role, as defined by the checked boxes.
These roles, added for your convenience, can be removed or altered based on your needs (*see Table 1*).
Each default role and sample user comes with a standard set of permissions, which provides for a specific set of capabilities when using SuiteCRM Analytics tools and the SuiteCRM Analytics Server (*see Table 2*).

4. Select the *System Roles* tab to display the user's system role.
System Roles are built-in roles used to control default behaviors and permissions in the User Console, handled implicitly or through system configuration, with automatic assignments.
The default system role for all users is *Authenticated*.
If you want to restrict permissions, the Authenticated role must be restricted or removed from the user.

+
[options="header",cols=" ,a"]
|=======================
|Field |Description
|Recurrence |Choose a time interval for the report from the Recurrence list.
Options include:

* Run Once: Runs the file one time.
* Seconds: Runs the file repeatedly at the time interval (in seconds) specified in the Recurrence pattern.
* Minutes: Runs the file repeatedly at the time interval (in minutes) specified in the Recurrence pattern.
* Hours: Runs the file repeatedly at the time interval (in hours) specified in the Recurrence pattern.

Click View Blockout Times to view the list of blockout times.

|Recurrence Pattern |Depending your selected time interval in the Recurrence field, specify the recurrence pattern.
|Range of Recurrence |Specify the start and end dates for running this report.
The report will begin running according to the specified recurrence pattern on the start date specified and complete its run cycle on the end date specified in this section.
|Start Date (Run Once) |If you select ‘Run Once’ for Recurrence, then specify the date to run the report.
|Cron String (Cron) |If you select ‘Cron’ for Recurrence, then specify the Cron syntax. Consult the
*Quartz Cron Attributes* reference to learn the Quartz Cron syntax.
|=======================
+
*Important!* When you set up a *Cron* schedule you must remember that it will start at *12 noon server time* in the *Start Date* selected.
This means if you create a new schedule at *9am* to run every 15 minutes, it will only start running at *12:00* on the Start Date selected. To make sure your cron schedule starts executing straight away its best to select the day prior to today's date.
That will allow the cron job to be active right away.

8. Click *Next*.
The selected report may run using several parameters which you may be asked to specify, such as output type.

9. If your SuiteCRM Analytics administrator has set up an email server, you may elect to email a copy of the report to selected users.

After a report is scheduled by any user, an admin may edit, pause, or delete that
schedule, as well as change the frequency of the report, change parameters, or adjust email
settings.
To distribute reports using email, make sure you have configured the email server.

== Set Up Emails for Scheduled Reports
A convenient way to share reports is to specify an email server to be used by the SuiteCRM Analytics
Server to send these reports to recipients.
This feature works with the report scheduling feature to automate the process of emailing reports to your user community.
Having an email server is not required to configure the SuiteCRM Analytics Server.
If you want to get started quickly or do not have information about your email server, skip this for now.
You can always come back to it later.

|Hostname (SMTP) |Address of your SMTP email server for sending
email.
|Port |Port of your SMTP email server, usually 25. For
Gmail, the value is 587.
|Use Authentication |Enable to use authentication for email.
User Name User ID to connect to the email server for sending email.
|Password |Password used to connect to the email server.

3. Click *Test Email Configuration*, then click *Save*.
A success message appears.

== Quartz Cron Attributes
The Quartz cron engine supports a seven-attribute time declaration with many possible values.
The number format is the same for every expression, even if the values are different -- it must be listed as seconds, minutes, hours, day of month, month, day of week, then the year.
A space separates each attribute.

These are the possible values for each attribute: 0 to 59 for seconds and minutes, 0 to 23 for hours, 1 to 31 for days, 1 to 12 for months, 1 to 7 for day of week, and a four-digit year.
Alternatively, you can use three-letter values for the day of week (SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT).
However, three-letter values for the month (JAN, FEB, etc.) are not supported.
For months, use numbers 1-12.

An asterisk (*) indicates all values, so an asterisk in the minute field would mean that the report runs once every minute.
You can specify a range of values with the - (dash) operator, and you can specify multiple individual values with a comma.
If you need to excuse a value in the day of month and day of week field from a cron job, you can use the question mark (?) character to indicate that this value doesn't matter.
If you need to split values, you can do so with the slash (/) character -- this operator literally means "every," so 0/15 would mean "Every 15."
In the day of month field, you can use the # character to indicate a certain instance of a day of the month, for instance the second Friday of the month would be 6#2.

You can use a capital L in the day of month and day of week field to indicate "Last," as in the last day of the week or month.
A capital W in the day of month attribute means "Weekday," which only encompasses Monday through Friday.
The W character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.
Most of these values can be combined to accommodate unusual cron schedules.

== Data Cache
The SuiteCRM Analytics Server comes with *Data Caching* capabilities.
When a report or dashboard is run, certain data will be cached for future executions.
It's important to understand that when the Data Warehouse is updated you may also have to refresh the SuiteCRM Analytics Server Cache.

=== Refresh CDA Cache
The *CDA Cache* serves the charts and dashboards supplied with SuiteCRM Analytics.
This also includes any charts that are rendered in reports.
To refresh this cache you can follow these steps

1. Log on to the Suitecrm Analytics Console

2. Click the *Tools* menu

3. Select *Refresh* > *CDA Cache*

This will open a new tab informing you when the *CDA* cache has been cleared.
