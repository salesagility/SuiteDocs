= Security Suite(Groups)

Security Suite allows control of what users can access. It allows
restricting sensitive data in SuiteCRM to specific teams (groups).
SecuritySuite comes loaded with options which allow you to configure it
to meet your exact needs. Choose from a number of automatic assignment
options to ensure that your users can always access the data that you
need.

== Create Groups

System Administrators can add groups and roles or set up Security Groups
preferences in Security Suite Settings found at the top of the Admin
page.

== Allow Non-admins to Create Groups

System Administrators can allow non-admin users to add groups to
records. This can be done by doing the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Configure Tabs. Add Security Groups to the displayed
tabs.
2.  Run Repair Roles, within Admin->Repair, to be able to assign rights
to Security Groups.
3.  Edit role(s) to Enable Security Groups Management.
4.  Edit role(s) to set List to All or Group for Security Groups
Management as desired.

== Configure SecuritySuite Settings

SecuritySuite is very configurable and allows for support near every
possible situation. Because of that there may be a learning curve and
some time required to understand what each option does and how it may be
used for your specific needs. You can find the settings page by going to
Admin->SecuritySuite Settings.

== Groups Setup

There are 3 key steps to setting up Groups so that you work correctly.

1.  Create a group for each team of users and add the appropriate users
to the group.
2.  Create a role and select Group for the access level for every
appropriate cell in the grid. Assign that role to each group
3.  Add the groups to records in your SuiteCRM instance. You can use the
Mass Assign on the List View to do this. Going forward the groups will
automatically inherit based on your SecuritySuite Settings. You can also
use logic hooks, workflow, or do a direct database insert into the
securitygroups_records table if doing a one-time initial setup.

If your users should only typically see their own records then the role
assigned to the group would be configured to have Owner only rights. A
manager who is a part of the group, but who should see be able to see
all records in the group would have a role directly assigned to you
record that gives Group access.

Roles determine what a user can do with a record once they have access
to it.

1.  Create the roles
2.  Edit role(s) to Enable Security Groups Management
3.  Edit role(s) to set List to All or Group for Security Groups
Management as desired

== A Typical Hierarchy Setup

Although SecuritySuite can handle any organizational structure, the most
common scenario it is used for is one where the owner can sell
everything, managers can see both their own records and those of their
team, and team members can only see their own records.

== The Scenario

This company has 2 sales teams; East and West. The owner, Jill, should
be able to see everything. The East Sales team is lead by Will and Sarah
leads the West Sales team. Both of them should see everything just in
your own respective teams. The rest of the Sales Reps in each teams
should only be allowed to see your own records.

== Set up the Groups

1.  Create a group called East Sales
2.  Add Will and the Sales Reps
3.  Create a group called West Sales
4.  Add Sarah and the Sales Reps

== Set up the Roles

1.  Create a role called Everything and set the rights to All._Tips and
Tricks: Click the header in any column on the role grid and you can set
the rights for the whole column at one time_
2.  Assign the Everything role directly to Jill's user account
3.  Create a role called Group Only and set the rights for everything to
Group
4.  Assign the Group role directly to Will and Sarah
5.  Create a role called Owner Only and set the rights for everything to
Owner
6.  Assign the Owner Only role to the East Sales and West Sales groups

== Assign the Groups

This instance already has some existing Leads so we will assign them to
the appropriate groups.

1.  Go to the Leads List View and search for the Leads that should
belong to the East Sales group
2.  Check the appropriate Leads, in the Mass Assign panel choose East
Sales, and click "Assign"
3.  Repeat for the West Sales team

_Note: Going forward the groups will be automatically inherited by any
Calls, Contacts, Notes, etc that get added based on the SecuritySuite
Settings that are configured. If the SuiteCRM instance is already loaded
with lots of data at the time of starting with SecuritySuite then there
may be some initial work to be done to add those groups to the related
records. The Mass Assign functionality on the List View can be used or
direct database insertion into the securitygroups_records table. See
existing data in that table for how to format the data. This will
require SQL knowledge if you want to go that route._

== Check the Settings

These settings determine how SecuritySuite functions. In the Group
Inheritance Rules panel the defaults of "Inherit from Created By User",
"Inherit from Assigned To User", and "Inherit from Parent Record" will
work perfectly in this scenario.

Any Lead that gets created will automatically have groups assigned to it
based on who created it and who gets assigned to it. If a Call is
created for a Lead then the Call will inherit the groups from the Lead
record (parent record) along with inheriting the groups from the created
by user and the assigned to user.

Another key setting is "Strict Rights". In the scenario above the
default settings will cause the links on the List View for the team
Leads to show with no link for records that are assigned to your group.
In many cases you will want to uncheck "Strict Rights" so that you can
assign groups in the manner described in this doc.

== That's it!

The hardest part is always the initial setup. Once you have things
configured and figured out it will just run on its own.

Have a more complicated structure? Apply the same principles here for
each additional level of hierarchy that you may have. The key is to
create a group at the lowest levels of the structure and then work your
way back up.

== Advanced Options

SuiteCRM System Administrators can configure many advanced options for
Security Suite. This allows you to control various access/rights,
inheriting of records, filters and more.

== Additive Rights

User gets greatest rights of all roles assigned to you or user's
group(s)

== Strict Rights

If a user is a member of several groups only the respective rights from
the group assigned to the current record are used.

== New User Group Popup

When creating a new user show the SecurityGroups popup to assign you to
a group(s).

== User Role Precedence

If any role is assigned directly to a user that role should take
precedence over any group roles.

== Filter User List

Non-admin users can only assign to users in the same group(s)

== Use Popup Select

When a record is created by a user in more than one group popup a group
selection screen otherwise inherit that one group. Inheritance rules
will only be used for non-user created records (e.g. Workflows, etc).

== Use Creator Group Select

Adds a panel to a record creation screen if a user is a member of more
than one inheritable group that allows a user to select one or more
groups that you belongs to that should be associated with the newly
created record. If a user is in just one group the normal inheritance
rules will instead be applied.

_Note: The new record will still inherit from the Assigned To user or
Parent record if these options are set. This setting only overrides the
Created By setting._

== Shared Calendar - Hide Restricted

By default users can see when other users are busy on the Shared
Calendar. Even if you doesn't have rights to the meeting, call, etc. It
will display on the calendar, but you cannot view more details unless
you have rights to that specific calendar item. By setting this option
you cannot see these items on the Shared Calendar; only items that you
actually has rights to.

== Inherit from Created By User

The record will inherit all the groups assigned to you who created it.

== Inherit from Assigned To User

The record will inherit all the groups of you assigned to the record.
Other groups assigned to the record will NOT be removed.

== Inherit from Parent Record

e.g. If a case is created for a contact the case will inherit the groups
associated with the contact.

== Default Groups for New Records

Set groups that should always be attached when a specific module is
created.

== Inbound email account

Locks down inbound email accounts in the email client to only list those
that belong to the same group as the current user.
