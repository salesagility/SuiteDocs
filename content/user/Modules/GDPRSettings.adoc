= GDPR Settings

== Overview

In order to facilitate GDPR compliance, *SuiteCRM 7.10* introduces two *Opt In* settings, *Opt In* and *Confirmed Opt In*.

. *Opt In* is used to indicate that a Contact, Lead or Target has opted in to receive marketing communications.

. *Confirmed Opt In* further requires users to confirm their opt-in status by clicking a link sent to them via email. This email can be configured to send automatically (e.g. on submission of a Web-To-Person form) or manually, and the template used to send this email can be customised.

Once Opt In settings have been selected:

* An additional *Opt In* checkbox will be visible in *Detail* and *Edit* views for email address fields in Contacts, Leads and Targets.

* *Opt In*, *Confirmed Opt In* and *Pending Confirmed Opt In* status will be visible in List view for records in these modules.

* Web-To-Person Forms will automatically include an *Opt In* checkbox.

* Campaign emails will NOT be sent to email addresses which are not marked as *Opt In* or *Confirmed Opt In*, depending on which settings you choose here.
 
== Opt In Email Settings

To configure your Opt In settings, open the *Admin* panel and select *Email Settings*. Opt In settings can be found on the *Email Options* panel.

=== Opt In

Select *Opt In* from the Opt In Settings: menu.

There is no need to configure the other Opt In settings, as Opt In emails are not sent with this setting.

Click btn:[SAVE]

=== Confirmed Opt In

Select *Confirmed Opt In* from the Opt In Settings: menu.

With this setting, users are required to further confirm their opt in by clicking a link sent to them via email. 

Select *Automatic Opt In Email* to have this email sent automatically (e.g. on submission on a Web-To-Lead form).
The default template for these emails is the Confirmed Opt In template. You can edit this template from the link:../../core-modules/8emails#_email_templates[Email Templates] module, but note that it must contain the Opt In link.

== Email Opt In Indication 

=== List and Detail View

Once *Opt In* or *Confirmed Opt In* is set, the status of a Contact, Lead or Target email address is indicated in both List view and Detail view with a tick or double tick.

|image:GDPRSingleGrayTick.png[title = "Pending List View"]|Email addresses which are pending an email confirmation are indicated with a single grey tick.

=== Edit View

An *Opted In* checkbox indicates the opt in status in Edit view.

Note that for *Confirmed Opt In*, checking the *Opted In* box here will result in a status of *Pending Confirmation*, rather than *Confirmed Opt In*. 
The user will still be required to confirm their opt in via email.

== Sending/Resending Opt In Email Manually

If you have *Confirmed Opt In* configured, the confirmation emails can be sent/resent either in bulk or individually.

To send in bulk, select the records to send to and select *Send Confirm Opt In Email* from the *Bulk Action* menu.

To send to an individual, open the record and select *Send Confirm Opt In Email* from the *Actions* menu.

== Campaigns

Your GDPR settings will affect your target lists for Campaigns. Campaign emails will NOT be sent to email addresses unless they are *Opted In* or *Confirmed Opted In*, depending on which settings you have chosen.

=== Web To Person Form Opt In

When creating a Web To Person form, an *Opt In* checkbox will be automatically added after the email address field if *Opt In* or *Confirmed Opt In* is configured. 

image:GDPRCreatePersonForm.png[title="Web To Person form"]

If the user checks this box, the email address will be set as *Opted In* (or *Pending Confirmation* if you have *Confirmed Opt In* configured) when the record is created in *SuiteCRM*.

Note that if you have *Confirmed Opt In* configured and *Automatic Opt In Email* selected, the Opt In email will be sent automatically following submission of the form. If *Automatic Opt In Email* is not selected, these emails will need to be sent <<Sending/Resending Opt In Email Manually,manually>>.
