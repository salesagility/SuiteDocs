= Summary

In this chapter, we covered all elements of the SuiteCRM user interface, which you can use to optimise your navigation
and data management, to increase productivity.

In the next chapter, we will look at modules. Modules are the data
entities within SuiteCRM which can be standalone, or related to one or
many other modules. Each module has a different function but many
modules work together to structure and automate day to day business
processes.
