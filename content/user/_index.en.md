## The SuiteCRM Team and Community

It is safe to say without the constant work from the SuiteCRM Team and
Community, I would not have had the drive and commitment to sit down and
write this user guide. New functionality and improvements to the core
product are constantly added to make SuiteCRM the best Open Source CRM
product in the world, and to compete with proprietary CRM vendors such
as SugarCRM, Salesforce and Microsoft.

As for The SuiteCRM Community - they provide bug reports, bug fixes and
bug testing. The Community is at the heart of any Open Source project
and this is no different with SuiteCRM. With each new release the
community grows and with it grow the benefits of the Open Source
ecosystem.

## Jason Eggers

Jason Eggers developed Security Suite. Security Suite allows control of
what users can access. It can restrict the access of sensitive data in
SuiteCRM to specific teams (groups). SecuritySuite comes loaded with
options which allow you to configure it to meet your exact needs. Choose
from a number of automatic assignment options to ensure that your users
can always access the data that you need. Jason and his team have
contributed the Security Suite section of the documentation. They know
the application inside out and provide great support. A feature packed
premium version of Security Suite is available at [the SuiteCRM
Store](https://store.suitecrm.com/). The SuiteCRM Store
provides curated add-ons with unrivalled support. Visit the website for
a full list of third party modules available for SuiteCRM.

## Dale Murray

Dale Murray is the Head of Consulting at SalesAgility. Dale wrote the
original guides for Advanced OpenSales, Advanced OpenWorkflow, Advanced
OpenPortal, Advanced OpenEvents and Reschedule. All of these modules
were originally extensions to SugarCRM Community Edition which were
written and maintained by SalesAgility. These are now within the core of
SuiteCRM. Each guide has been fully updated to incorporate the new
functionality that has been added to these modules within SuiteCRM.

## What is SuiteCRM?

SuiteCRM is a software fork of the popular [Customer Relationship
Management](https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://suitecrm.com/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) (CRM) system
[SugarCRM](https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://suitecrm.com/wiki/SugarCRM),
developed and maintained by SalesAgility. It is a free and open source
alternative application. It was released on October 21, 2013 as version
7.0. The latest production version at the time of publishing this User
Guide is SuiteCRM 7.6.3.

SuiteCRM has been downloaded more than 500,000 times since the original
release. It has been adopted by NHS (National Health Service) England's
Code for Health programme which seeks to foster open source in the NHS
in England.

The SuiteCRM project has stated that the every line of code released by
the project will be open source. SuiteCRM project is intended to be an
enterprise-class open source alternative to proprietary products.

A project Roadmap is available that details planned enhancements.

An active public support forum with more than 25,000 members is
available for free support and is regularly monitored and updated by the
Project team.

A directory of extensions is available where both free and paid-for
enhancements are available.

The project maintains
[SuiteCRM:OnDemand](https://suitecrmondemand.com/), a
Software As A Service facility for users who seek a rapid deployment and
maintenance free service.

There will be no licensed software as part of the project managed by
SalesAgility. All the code is free. All the code is available for free
download. There is no hidden agenda to charge for access to the code. It
is and always will be free and open source. There will be no paid-for
versions.

# What is in the User Guide?

The SuiteCRM User Guide has been written for the end user. This guide
covers the SuiteCRM User Journey from end-to-end. We will explore all
areas from the basics of logging into the system to creating complex
automated workflows and reports.

The SuiteCRM User Guide is split into various chapters. These chapters
are ordered so that you progress through you guide as you would
logically in day to day CRM use. The chapters contain sub-sections which
break down barriers for you, explaining how to optimise the use of the
customer relationship management system to effectively manage sales
data.

Readers of the SuiteCRM User Guide do not need to have development
knowledge or prior knowledge of SuiteCRM. It is advised that you are
computer literate, that you are familiar with using your chosen web
browser and that SuiteCRM has already been installed and configured.

# Getting Started


## Logging Into SuiteCRM

SuiteCRM allows users to log in using your Username and Password,
provided to you by the System Administrator.

Before logging into SuiteCRM, you can select the language you wish to
use. There are many default languages for SuiteCRM and there are also
additional language packs available for other languages around the
world.

Once you have chosen your language and have entered your user
credentials, you will be able to click the Login button to access the
CRM.

## Forgotten Password


If you forget your CRM password and cannot access your CRM user account,
you can use the 'Forgotten Password' feature to re-send your password to
the email address associated to your user account. Clicking the 'Forgot
Password?' link on the login form will display the forgotten password
form.

functionality to retrieve a users password in the event of the password
being lost or forgotten.

In the next chapter we will cover the User Wizard, which allows you to
set your preferences when using SuiteCRM.

## User Wizard


The User Wizard guides you through the configuration options available
to you post login. This allows you to select many formats for data that
will display in SuiteCRM, and these are specific to your user.

Clicking 'Finish' will complete the User Wizard and will present you
with SuiteCRM login form.

## Summary


In this chapter, we progressed through the User Wizard. This allows you
to set your preferences when using SuiteCRM.

In the next chapter, we will cover managing user accounts, which will
discuss how to update user details, select themes, change passwords and
more.

## Managing User Accounts

## Summary


In this chapter, we covered managing a user account. This allows you to
manage your information, modify/reset user preferences and more.

In the next chapter, we will cover the Interface. The Interface is an
integral part of SuiteCRM. With the knowledge of your Interface, you can
progress to learning more about SuiteCRM functionality and processes.

## User Interface


Before we progress to understanding the structure and functionality of
SuiteCRM, we will cover the areas of the User Interface so that you are
familiar with terminology used when describing navigating SuiteCRM.
There are many elements to the User Interface, so we have broken these
down into various sections below.


## Navigation Elements


The ability to easily view and navigate to areas of the CRM is key to
improved productivity and user adoption. SuiteCRM has a clear UI which
has various elements we will cover in this section.

### Top navigation menu

The top navigation menu is the main menu users will use to navigate to
modules to create and manage records. The standard layout for the top
navigation is a list of 10 modules. The ordering for this menu is
determined by the order of the modules in Admin → Display Modules and
Subpanels. The top navigation menu has six elements. These are:

-   CRM Name – This is the name for the CRM which is specified on
    installation. This defaults to SuiteCRM.
-   Module Menu – This lists or groups the modules, dependent on the
    user preference. This provides the ability for users to navigate to
    modules within the CRM.
-   Desktop Notification Count – This shows the number of desktop
    notifications the user has not yet read. These can be managed by the
    user. For full details on Desktop Notifications, see the [Desktop
    Notifications](#Desktop_Notifications) section within this user
    guide.
-   Quick Create – Quick create allows the quick creation of key module
    records globally within the CRM.
-   Global/Full Text Search – Allows users to search the CRM globally
    for records/data.
-   User menu – This displays the user name for the user currently
    logged in. There is a drop down menu which gives users access to
    Employees, their profile, the about page and a link to logout.

![Image20.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/thumb/a/a1/Image20.png/880px-Image20.png)

To view a module, you can click on the module name. This will take you
to the List View of that module. For full details on views, read the
[Views](#Views) section of this user guide.

Hovering over a module name will produce a drop down menu. This drop
down menu displays the Actions and Recently Viewed records for that
module.

![Image21.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/b9/Image21.png)

You can edit records displayed in the Recently Viewed section of the
drop down menu by clicking the pencil icon. This will direct you to the
Edit View for that record.

![Image22.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/06/Image22.png)

There is also a grouped tab navigation structure for SuiteCRM. Users can
set this option in their user preferences. For full details on modifying
user preferences, see the [Managing User
Accounts](#Managing_User_Accounts) section of this user guide.

![Image23.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/d/d0/Image23.png)

The grouped tab navigation menu gives the user the ability to group
modules within a tab such as the Sales Tab.

![Image24.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/7/76/Image24.png)

### Quick Create

You can click the plus '+' icon in the top navigation menu to access the
Quick Create options. This is a list of commonly used modules with the
ability to create new records within these modules from any location.

![Image25.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/c/c3/Image25.png)

### The Sidebar

The sidebar is part of the responsive theme and is a user configurable
option. The sidebar can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the
button highlighted below.

![Image26.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/6/6d/Image26.png)

**Actions**

This displays the Actions for the module you are currently viewing. For
example, if you are viewing the Accounts module, the actions that
display are: Create Account, View Accounts, Import Accounts. This
provides you with one-click access to module actions.

**Recently Viewed**

This section displays the last 10 records you have viewed. This leaves a
breadcrumbs trail so that previously viewed records can be quickly and
easily accessed via the sidebar. There is also the option to click the
pencil icon, which will take you directly to the Edit View of the
record.

## Home Page


The home page is the first page that is displayed to you
post-authentication. The home page has various elements that can be used
and configured such as Dashlets, Dashboards and the Sidebar.

### Dashlets

Dashlets are user-configurable sections displayed on the home page that
give you a quick overview of your records and activity immediately after
login. This is particularly useful for sales and support led teams as
this reduces the number of clicks required to view/modify data.

Dashlets can be dragged/dropped within the home page. You can add
dashlets by clicking the 'Add Dashlets' link on the home page.

![Image27.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/5c/Image27.png)

Clicking on the 'Add Dashlets' link on the home page will open up the
Add Dashlets popup which allows users to select from a multitude of out
of the box dashlets.

![Image28.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/4/40/Image28.png)

To add one of the dashlets, simply click on the dashlet link. This will
add the dashlet to the user home page. The popup will remain if you add
a dashlet, to allow users to add multiple dashlets. Once you have added
your required dashlets, you can close the popup.

![Image29.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/5b/Image29.png)

You can modify dashlets by clicking the pencil icon on the desired
dashlet.

![Image30.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/f/fc/Image30.png)

Clicking the pencil icon will display a popup. This popup will contain
all of the options that are configurable for the dashlet.

![Image31.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/0c/Image31.png)

Once you have made the required changes in the dashlet configuration
popup, you can click 'Save' to apply the changes, or cancel if you wish
to revert to the current configuration.

*Note: Some dashlets require the home page to be reloaded. For dashlets
that require this, you will be notified.*

### Dashboards

Dashboards are new in SuiteCRM. These are configurable per user and can
be added/removed similar to dashlets. To add a dashboard tab, you can
click the 'Add Tab' link on the homepage.

![Image32.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/b5/Image32.png)

Clicking on the 'Add Tab' link on the home page will open up the Add Tab
popup which allows users to specify a name for the tab and also how many
dashlet columns are required. You can opt for one, two or three columns.

![Image33.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/c/cb/Image33.png)

Once you have specified the details for the dashboard tab, you can click
'Save'. You can also click 'Cancel' to undo any changes. Once you have
saved your changes, the Dashboard Tab will be added and will display on
the tab list on user Homepage. You can then add Dashlets to your new
dashboard tab.

![Image34.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/d/db/Image34.png)

If you wish to delete the dashboard tab, you can click the 'x' icon.
This will prompt you to confirm the deletion and then subsequently
remove the dashboard tab from your profile only. Note: 'Suite Dashboard'
is the standard dashboard tab which cannot be removed. You can however
configure the dashlets that display on that dashboard tab.


### Activity Stream

The Activity Stream is an excellent way of keeping track of your
colleague's interactions with SuiteCRM. By default the Activity Stream
displays recent updates for the Opportunities, Contacts, Leads and Cases
modules. Your organisation's Facebook and Twitter feeds can also be
included in your Activity Steam dashlets if desired and this can be
configurable by an Admin user.

![My Activity
Stream.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/f/f9/My_Activity_Stream.png)

You can also comment about an update within the Activity Stream by
clicking on the Reply button on the right side of the post.

![Reply Delete.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/7/70/Reply_Delete.png)

Your posts can also be deleted from the Activity Stream by clicking on
the Delete button.

![Activity Stream
Comment.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/e/ea/Activity_Stream_Comment.png)

Your comment will appear under the original post and will also be
timestamped.

The Activity Stream is also a useful tool for internal messaging within
your organisation, it is possible to send a message that will be
broadcast to all users in your network. To do this type your message in
the text field and click post.

![Activity Stream
Update.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/d/d6/Activity_Stream_Update.png)

Your colleagues will see this message and will be able to respond by
clicking on the Reply button on the right side of the post.

![Activity Stream Update
Reply.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/d/db/Activity_Stream_Update_Reply.png)

Their response will appear under your post, again with a timestamp.

## Search


Searching is a vital aspect within the CRM as this allows you to quickly
define what it is you want to see. Many CRM's will have large data sets
so it is vital to you that you have a way to refine your search. In the
following sub-sections we will cover the various searching options
available to you.

### Global Search

You can search all records within the CRM using the global search
functionality. You can search for records via global search by using the
search bar in the main navigation menu.

![Image35.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/1c/Image35.png)

Once you have entered your search term, you can press the return key or
click the magnifying glass/search icon. This will return records that
match the search criteria and categorise them by the modules available.

![Image36.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/0b/Image36.png)

Modules can be added to the global search functionality by the System
Administrator.

### Full Text Search

SuiteCRM has an option to enable or disable a full text global search.
The full text global search is powered by [Zend
Lucene](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.search.lucene.overview.html) search framework. The search works very similar to the standard
global search, but provides the enhanced functionality of searching text
in documents and other files, compared to the record-level search
provided by the standard global search.

*Note: System Administrators can enable/disable the full text search by
clicking on the AOD Settings link within the admin panel.*

![Image37.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/02/Image37.png)

This will display the AOD option to enable/disable the full text search.

![Image38.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/a/a1/Image38.png)

The search returns results slightly different to global search. Results
are returned in order of score. Records are scored dependent on how well
you match the search criteria provided by you – from 0-100%.

![Image39.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/bb/Image39.png)

### Basic Module Search

Basic search is available on all modules within the CRM. Basic search,
as standard, allows users to search on the record name.

![Image40.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/a/a7/Image40.png)

Basic search also allows users to check the 'My Items' check box.
Enabling this option will only return records that are assigned to you.

![Image41.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/4/4d/Image41.png)

Once a user has searched for a record, the search will be saved. This
means that you can navigate to records and other modules within the CRM
but the search will not be cleared. If you wish to clear your search,
you can click 'Clear' and then click 'Search'. This will clear any saved
searches and return to the default result set for that module.

*Note: System Administrators can modify which fields are searchable in
Basic Search within Studio.*

### Advanced Module Search

Advanced Search is available on all modules within the CRM. Advanced
Search provides you with a more detailed module search functionality. As
standard, there are more fields available to you via Advanced Search.

![Image42.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/8/84/Image42.png)

You can add further fields to the Advanced Search section by expanding
the 'Layout Options' panel.

![Image43.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/02/Image43.png)

You can click the field you wish to display/hide and click the arrows to
move these fields between sections. This allows users to display/hide
columns to further customise the Advanced Search section.

Advanced Searches may have many fields and specific criteria. For this
reason, You can save your advanced search criteria to easily populate
this in future.

![Image44.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/2/2e/Image44.png)

To load a saved search, you can select the saved search from the 'Saved
Searches' drop down and then click 'Search'. This will return results
that match the criteria specified in the saved search.

![Image45.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/3/36/Image45.png)

*Note: System Administrators can modify which fields are searchable in
Advanced Search within Studio.*

## Views


Within the CRM you will be presented with various views. These views are
structured to present you with key information through the record
management process. There are three main views:

-   List View
-   Detail View
-   Edit View

All of these views have specific purposes and these are described in the
sub-sections below.

### List View

This is the view that you are presented with when you navigate to your
desired module.

![Image46.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/b3/Image46.png)

The List View compromises of many actions that you can carry out to
manage records. These are:


-   Search Records – provides you with the ability to perform basic and
    advanced searches, as covered previously in the [Search](#Search)
    section of this chapter.
-   Sort Records – clicking on the column name will sort the record list
    by that column either ascending or descending, if sorting is
    enabled.
-   View Records – clicking on any hyperlinked data will take you to the
    Detail View of the record.
-   Edit Records – clicking the pencil icon will navigate you to the
    Edit View for that record.
-   Delete Records – you can select records and then select the delete
    option to delete records from the module.
-   Mass Update Records – you can select records and then select the
    mass update option to update data on all selected records.
-   Merge Records – you can select records and select the merge option.
    This will begin the merge records processes. You can select a
    primary record and then can merge the data from the duplicate
    records into the primary record. Once saved, the duplicate records
    will be deleted and all data/history merged to the primary record.

### Detail View

This is the view that you are presented with when you view a record.

![Image47.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/3/35/Image47.png)

The Detail View compromises of many actions that you can use to
view/manage your data. These are specific to the Detail View of the
module that you are viewing. There are standard actions on the Detail
View for most modules. These are:

-   Edit – allows you to edit the record you are viewing.
-   Duplicate – allows you to duplicate the record the are viewing.
-   Delete – allows you to delete the record you are viewing. If a
    record is deleted, you will be redirected to the List View.
-   Find Duplicates – allows you to begin the find duplicates process
    where you can use system functionality to find duplicate records.
-   View Change Log – allows you to view changes to audited fields.

*Note: To set fields as audited and for any changes to find duplicates,
contact your System Administrator.*

Hyperlinked fields can be clicked on. This will navigate you to that
record.

The Detail View is tabbed in SuiteCRM. This means there is minimal
scrolling and data is categorised for each module in the appropriate
tab.

*Note: System Administrators can select to display data in either tabs
or panels. You can contact your system administrator for more
information on managing layouts and views.*

### Edit View

This is the view that you are presented with when you edit a record.

![Image48.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/b7/Image48.png)

The Edit View allows you to modify record information that is displayed
on the view. This allows users to update existing data and also
add/remove data. Once you have made changes on the Edit View, you can
click 'Save' to apply to changes or click 'Cancel'. Clicking either
options will redirect you to the Detail View of the record you are
editing. You can click the 'View Change Log' button. This allows users
to view changes to audited fields which can be useful before making your
intended changes.

## Record Management


We have covered the several views that you are presented with so we will
now move onto record management. In this section we will cover all areas
of record management so that you can efficiently store and manage
customer data.

### Creating Records

You can create records within modules from various different areas of
your Interface. Detailed below are screen shots of record creation
points.

![Image49.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/d/dc/Image49.png)

![Image50.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/0c/Image50.png)

![Image51.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/a/a8/Image51.png)

Once you click the create button, you will be taken to the creation
screen. This is essentially the Edit View that we have covered
previously in the [User Interface](#User_Interface) section. This allows
you to fill in the appropriate data for that record. Fields with the red
star(\*) are required fields. Validation is performed so that a record
cannot be saved within the CRM unless data is valid for required fields.

![Image52.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/2/25/Image52.png)

Once you have populated all data for the record, you can save the record
which will create the record within the module in the CRM. Once saved,
you will be redirected to the Detail View of the record you have
created.

### Editing Records

You can edit records within modules from various different areas of your
Interface. Detailed below are screen shots of record editing points.

![Image53.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/e/ec/Image53.png)

![Image54.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/1f/Image54.png)

![Image55.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/6/61/Image55.png)

Once you click the edit button(or pencil), you will be taken to the Edit
View. This allows you to edit/populate the appropriate data for that
record. Fields with the red star(\*) are required fields. Validation is
performed so that a record cannot be saved within the CRM unless data is
valid for required fields.

Once you have edited/populated the record data, you can save the record
which will update the existing record with the new data populated when
editing. Once saved, you will be redirected to the Detail View of the
record you have edited.

### Deleting Records

You can delete records within modules from both the List View and Detail
View. Detailed below are screen shots of record editing points:

**Detail View Deletion method**

Deleting records from the Detail View is a simple process. You simply
have to click the 'Delete' button.

![Image56.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/9/9b/Image56.png)

When you click the delete button on a record, you will receive a popup
which will ask you to confirm that you want to delete the record.

![Image57.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/02/Image57.png)

You can either click Cancel or OK. Clicking Cancel will revert you back
to the Detail View of the record and will not delete it. Clicking OK
will action the record deletion. If you choose to delete the record, the
record will be deleted and you will be redirected to the module List
View.

**List View Deletion method**

To delete records from the List View, you can select records using the
checkbox option on the left hand side of the view. It is possible to
select single records or use the 'Select this Page' or 'Select All'
options, to select all records from the page or all records within the
module.

![Image58.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/bc/Image58.png)

Once the records are selected to delete, you can click the 'Delete'
button. When you click the delete button on a record, you will receive a
popup which will display the number of records being deleted and ask you
to confirm that you want to delete the record.

![Image59.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/17/Image59.png)

You can either click Cancel or OK. Clicking Cancel will revert you back
to the Detail View of the record and will not delete it. Clicking OK
will action the record deletion. If you choose to delete the record, the
record will be deleted and you will be redirected to the module List
View.

### Mass Updating Records

You can mass update records from the List View of any module, given this
option is made available to you. To mass update records, you have to
check the records in the List View and then select the 'Mass Update'
option from the dropdown menu (next to the delete link).

![Image60.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/11/Image60.png)

Clicking the mass update option will display a screen at the bottom of
the List View. This will list all fields that can be mass updated by
you.

![Image61.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/d/da/Image61.png)

Once you have populated the fields you wish to mass update, you can
either click 'Update' or 'Cancel'. Cancelling the mass update will
cancel any changes and redirect you to the List View of the module.
Clicking update will update all selected records with the changes
specified in the [Mass Updating Records](#Mass_Updating_Records)
section.

![Image62.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/51/Image62.png)

### Merging Records

You can merge records from the List View of any module, given this
option is made available to you, or via the Detail View if you follow
the 'Find Duplicates' process.

To merge records, you have to check the records in the List View and
then select the 'Merge' option from the dropdown menu (next to the
delete link).

![Image63.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/9/92/Image63.png)

Once you have clicked on the 'Merge' option, you will be presented with
a merge screen. This will show the primary record and the duplicates
that you wish to merge with that primary record.

![Image64.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/6/6c/Image64.png)

You can select which record is primary using the 'Set as primary' button
on the right of the merge view. You can move data from the duplicate
records to the primary record using the '&lt;&lt;' buttons. In this
example, we have moved the First Name and Last Name from the duplicate
record to the primary record.

![Image65.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/c/c8/Image65.png)

Once you have made the required changes on the merge screen, you can
click 'Save Merge' or 'Cancel'. Clicking cancel will discard the merge
changes and will revert you to the List View for that module. Clicking
'Save Merge' will continue the Merge process and will prompt you to
inform you that the duplicate record will be deleted.

![Image66.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/17/Image66.png)

You can click 'OK' or 'Cancel'. Clicking Cancel will discard the merge
changes and will revert you to the List View for that module. Clicking
'OK' will save the merge and will redirect you to the Detail View for
the merged record.

![Image67.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/b1/Image67.png)

As can be seen from the example, the merge has completed successfully.
The First Name and Last Name have been updated, and all other data has
been retained.

### Importing Records

It is possible to import data easily by using SuiteCRM's easy-to-use
User Import Wizard. There are many hints and tips as you progress
through the Import Wizard on the requirements of importing data and for
further steps in the Wizard.

**User Import Wizard features**

There are many features of the Import Wizard which make it easier for
you to map data to CRM fields and also for future imports. These are:

-   Sample .csv file for easier import of data — Use the available
    sample .csv file as a template for import of files
-   Retain settings from previous imports — Save/preserve import file
    properties, mappings, and duplicate check indexes from previous
    imports for ease of current data import process
-   Ability to accept both database name and display labels of drop-down
    and multi-select field items — Field labels as well as database
    names are accepted and mapped during import, but only the field
    labels are displayed for ease of use
-   Ability to accept both usernames and full names in user fields
    during import and export of data — Full names of Users displayed for
    Assigned To and other User-related fields in exported .csv file for
    easier identification of user records
-   Ability to auto-detect file properties in import file — Upload
    import files without specifying file properties such as tab, comma,
    double and single quotes, date and time formats, making the process
    simpler and faster
-   Ability to import contacts from external sources such as Google —
    Ability to import Google Contacts for person-type modules such as
    Contacts, Leads, and Targets, relate SuiteCRM records to Google
    Contacts, and communicate with Google Contacts from within SuiteCRM

**Steps to Import data**

*Note: Always import the Account data first and then import Contacts and
other data related to Accounts (such as Meetings, Calls, Notes) to
automatically create a relationship between the imported Account and
Contacts and activity records related to the Account.*

Follow the steps listed below to import data for a module, such as
Accounts:

1.  Select Import from the Actions drop-down list in the module menu
    options.
2.  This displays Step 1 of the import process with a link to a sample
    Import File Template.
3.  Upload your import file to this page using the Browse button in the
    Select File field or,
4.  Optionally, download the available template, delete the existing
    data, input your data and upload to this page using the Browse
    button.
5.  Click Next.
6.  This displays Step 2 (Confirm Import File Properties).
7.  Auto-detection of imported data takes place at this step.
8.  Click View Import File Properties button to verify and change the
    data as needed, if you notice irregularities in the Confirm Import
    File Properties table.
9.  Click the Hide Import File Properties to collapse the panel.
10. Click Next.
11. This displays Step 3: Confirm Field Mappings.
12. The table in this page displays all the fields in the module that
    can be mapped to the data in the import file. If the file contains a
    header row, the columns in the file map to matching fields.
13. Check for correct mapping and modify if necessary.
14. Map to all of the required fields (indicated by an asterisk).
15. Click Next.
16. This displays Step 4: Check for Possible Duplicates.
17. Follow the instructions on this page.
18. Step 4 also provides the option of saving the current import file
    properties, mappings, and duplicate check indexes for future
    imports.
19. (Optionally) Save the import settings.
20. Click Import Now.
21. Click the Errors tab to check for errors in the process. Follow the
    instructions to fix problems (if any) and Click Import Again.
22. This displays Step 1 of the import process.
23. Follow all the steps in the wizard through Step 5.
24. If the import was successful, you can to view all the imported
    records at Step 5.
25. Click Undo Import if you are not satisfied with the imported
    records,
26. Or, click Import Again to import more data
27. Or, click Exit to navigate to the List View page of the module that
    you imported your records into.

### Exporting Records

You can export SuiteCRM records in .csv format. When you exports records
from the CRM, you will be provided with the .csv file to download when
the export has finished executing. You can save and open this file in
applications such as Libre Office Calc or Microsoft Office Excel.

The .csv file displays in a tabular format with columns and rows. When
data is exported from the CRM, the record ID is included with all other
fields that are specified in the export list for that module. You can
then use the record ID as a reference for performing a 'Create new
records and update existing records' import, as detailed in the
[Importing Records](#Importing_Records) section of the user guide.

*Note: When exporting values from drop-down lists, SuiteCRM exports the
ID associated with each option and not the display labels. For example,
if a drop down list has options labelled High, Medium and Low with an ID
of 1, 2 and 3 – the .csv file will show the drop down options as 1, 2 or
3.*

**Steps to Export Records**

1.  Select the records from the List View on the module's home page.
2.  Select Export from the Actions drop-down menu in the List View.
3.  To export all records listed on the page, click Select located above
    the item list and select one of the following options:
4.  This Page. To export all the records listed on the page, select this
    option.
5.  All Records. To export all records on the list (if it is more than a
    page long), select this option.
6.  This displays an Opening.csv dialog box.
7.  Select Open to open the export file in .csv format or select Save to
    Disk to save the .csv file to your local machine.
8.  Click OK to execute the operation. If you chose to open the file,
    the csv file opens in Microsoft Excel.
9.  The file contains all the fields in the module from which you are
    exporting the data.

## In-line Editing


In-line editing gives you the ability to change values “on the fly”.
In-line editing has been implemented on both List View and Detail View,
providing an advantage to users wishing to change field values quickly,
reducing the number of clicks/processes that would normally be taken to
edit the full record.

*Note: In-line editing can be enabled/disabled for both List View and
Detail View. This can be done in the main System Settings for the CRM,
by the System Administrator.*

![Image68.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/2/26/Image68.png)


### List View In-line Editing

You can edit record information on the List View of a module using
in-line editing by clicking on a field where the pencil icon is shown.

## Summary


In this chapter, we covered all elements of the SuiteCRM user interface.
There are many elements which you can use to optimise your navigation
and data management, to increase productivity.

In the next chapter, we will look at modules. Modules are the data
entities within SuiteCRM which can be standalone, or related to one or
many other modules. Each module has a different function but many
modules work together to structure and automate day to day business
processes.

## Core Modules


## Accounts


The Accounts module is the centralised base from which you can create an
association with most records in SuiteCRM. It is possible to create a
relationship with Contacts, Converted Leads, Opportunities, any Activity
such as Emails or Meetings and Cases. Accounts in SuiteCRM will
typically hold all information specific to a company that your
organisation will have a relationship with. In real world terms an
Account may be a business entity that is a qualified Sales Prospect,
Customer, Supplier or Re-seller and can be used to track all
interactions that take place between these entities and your
organisation.

### Accounts Actions

You can access the accounts actions from the Accounts module menu drop
down or via the Sidebar. The Accounts actions are as follows:

-   Create Account – Once clicked, a new form is opened in Edit View to
    allow you to create a new Account record.
-   View Accounts – Once clicked, you will be redirected to the List
    View for the Accounts module. This allows you to search and list
    Accounts records.
-   Import Accounts – Redirects you to the Import Wizard for the
    Accounts module. For more information, see [Importing
    Records](#Importing_Records).

Techco is the Contact. This module holds all information relating to
these individuals and also provides a vantage point for any history
relating to a Contact record, for example if they were involved in a
Meeting, raised a Case or sent an Email.

## Leads


In SuiteCRM a Lead is an unqualified contact usually generated from some
form of marketing related event, for example it could be a person that
has filled out a form on your website or someone that you met at a trade
show and you are not sure yet if they have buying authority. Once a Lead
is qualified and converted then it can be split into three parts; a
Contact once you have established 'Who' it is, an Account when you know
'Where' they work and an Opportunity once it is known 'What' they might
buy.

![Convert Leads.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/0a/Convert_Leads.png)

If an Admin has amended the System Settings to disable actions within
menus then to Convert a Lead you will have to again click the individual
Lead record to access the Lead Detail View but this time click on the
Convert Lead button as shown below:

![Convert Lead Alternative.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/d/d1/Convert_Lead_Alternative.png)

Once you have clicked on 'Convert Lead' button then you will be taken to
the Convert Lead page.

### Convert Lead to Contact

On this page you will be able to Create or Select Contact:

![Convert to Contact.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/e/e2/Convert_to_Contact.png)

By deselecting the checkbox next to 'Create Contact' you will be able to
associate the Lead to an existing Contact. However, in most cases when
converting a Lead there will be no existing Contact. Make sure the
Create Contact checkbox is selected. Some of the fields will
automatically be populated using the Lead information. Fill out the
remaining relevant fields and move to the next Stage below:

### Convert Lead to Account

![Convert to Account.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/a/af/Convert_to_Account.png)

To create an Account from a converted Lead you will follow the same
process as with a Contact, some information will populate from the Lead
automatically, just complete the rest.

### Convert Lead to Opportunity

![Convert to Opportunity.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/e/e9/Convert_to_Opportunity.png)

To create an Opportunity from a converted Lead you will follow the same
process as with a Contact, some information will populate from the Lead
automatically, just complete the rest.

### Other Lead Conversion Options

Other records can be created when converting a Lead in the same way as
Contacts/Accounts and Opportunities.

![Convert other Options.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/a/ad/Convert_other_Options.png)

After you have completed the relevant sections click the Save button to
confirm the changes.

### Duplicate Record Check

When converting a Lead SuiteCRM will automatically check for any
duplicate records and will return a warning if a matching record is
found.

![Duplicate Warning.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/9/95/Duplicate_Warning.png)

If you find that the duplicate warning is not valid and you still wish
to create a new record, then click the Create button. Otherwise if you
decide that the warning is correct and the record does already exist in
the CRM then you should click on the Select button.

URLs.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/d/d3/Email_Tracker_URLs.png)

Please note that the 'Opt Out' link is added to the template
automatically even if you do not insert one at this point. Another
interesting feature of the Email Templates page is the ability to
personalise your templates by inserting variables. You can for example
insert the 'Account ID' variable in the subject line, or even insert the
addressee's first name and last name to add a more personal touch.

![Email
Variables.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/0c/Email_Variables.png)

The WYSIWYG editor is displayed at the bottom of the Email Template
page, this editor allows you to visualise how your template will
actually look.

![Email WYSIWIG
Editor.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/a/a4/Email_WYSIWIG_Editor.png)

The panel on the left side of the editor allows you to drag and drop
different layout components to your template. These then can be edited
in the right side display panel. Once you have inserted a component into
the display panel you can click on the added item and the editor menu
will appear.

![Email Template
Editor.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/3/36/Email_Template_Editor.png)

This menu provides you with a multitude of additional options which
allows you to customise the layout and appearance of your template. Font
type can be selected, formatted, colours changed, text alignment chosen,
images and even videos can be inserted.

Insert HTML by clicking Tools &gt; Source Code

The bottom panel offers the option to include attachments with your
Email Template, this could be used if for example you wished to attach a
something like a product catalogue to your Newsletter. Once you are
satisfied with your Email Template you can click Next and you will be
taken to the Marketing page which is the next stage of the Campaign
Wizard.

### Campaign Wizard Marketing

![Newsletter
Marketing.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/ba/Newsletter_Marketing.png)

This section of the Campaign Wizard allows you to specify the Email
settings for your Campaign including the Bounce Handling Account,
Outgoing Email Account, From/Reply-to Name and Address. In addition to
this, you can Schedule your Campaign by completing the Date and Time
fields. Once you are satisfied with your Email Settings and Schedule you
can click Next and you will be taken to the Summary page which is the
final stage of the Campaign Wizard.

### Campaign Wizard Summary

![Newsletter Summary Review.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/5a/Newsletter_Summary_Review.png)

The Summary page includes a checklist which indicates that each page of
the Campaign Wizard has been completed satisfactorily. If a section is
complete then this is shown with green tick icon, otherwise this will be
highlighted with a red cross icon. If any section has not been completed
then SuiteCRM will not permit the Campaign to be sent. In this instance
in the image shown above the 'Choose Targets' section has not been
completed correctly as indicated by the red cross icon. This would be
resolved by clicking back to the Target List page and specifying a
Subscription List with at least one entry. Once you have ensured all
sections are complete then you can choose one of three options:

-   Send Mail at Scheduled Time – You can click this once you are sure
    all sections of the Campaign are set correctly and are confident
    that it is the finished article.
-   Send Marketing Email as Test – This option gives you the opportunity
    to send out your Campaign to your Test List that you specified in
    the Subscriptions section of the Campaign Wizard. By doing this you
    can view the Campaign as a recipient and double check that the
    Campaign appears as it should do before sending out to real
    prospective/live customers.
-   View Details – By clicking this option you are taken to the Detail
    View of the Campaign record you have just created through the
    Newsletter Campaign Wizard.


### Create Person Form

Another feature of the Campaign module is the web form template Wizard
allowing you to create Leads, Contacts and Targets. This can be accessed
by clicking on the Create Person Form button from the dropdown menu in
the Campaign module or via the sidebar when in the module.

![Campaign Create Person Form.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/7/7a/Campaign_Create_Person_Form.png)

Once you have clicked this, you will be taken to the first page of the
Create Person Form Wizard.

![Campaign Person Fields.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/54/Campaign_Person_Fields.png)

This stage allows you to specify the type of person you would like to
create via your web form. The dropdown menu allows you to choose from a
Lead, Contact or Target. On selecting the person type you would like to
create the Available Fields dynamically change. Once you have chosen
this you can drag and drop the fields you would like to include on your
web form. Fields dropped into the First Form Column area are displayed
on the left side of your web form and the fields dropped into the Second
Form Column area are displayed on the right side of your web form. You
can choose to have 1 or 2 columns, all on the left side, right side or
on both sides. Please note as a minimum you need to include the required
fields included in your web form as indicated by an asterisk. Once you
are satisfied with the fields you wish to include click the Next button
to progress to the next stage.

### Create Person Form – Additional Information

![Campaign Create Person Additional Info.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/8/89/Campaign_Create_Person_Additional_Info.png)

On this page you can configure your web form appearance by adding a Form
Header/Footer, Form Description, change the label on the Submit button
or change how the URL is displayed. As a minimum you have to relate the
web form to an existing Campaign and assign to a User before clicking
the Generate Form button to progress to the next stage.

### Create Person Form – Editor

![Campaign Create Person Editor.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/e/e0/Campaign_Create_Person_Editor.png)

The final step of the Create Person Form Wizard allows you to format the
web form you have setup by using the WYSIWYG editor. This editor
provides you with a multitude of additional options which allows you to
customise the layout and appearance of your web form. Font type can be
selected, formatted, colours changed, text alignment chosen and images
can be inserted. Once you are happy with the appearance of your web form
click Save Web Form. On clicking this button you can either click on the
link to download the web form you have just created or copy and paste
the html to an existing document. By clicking the download link this
will save the html form in your download folder.

![Campaign Person
Link.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/e/e9/Campaign_Person_Link.png)

Please note that the web form will not be stored anywhere else on the
CRM, to ensure the html is saved please carry out one of the two steps
above.

### Campaign Response Tracking

When in the Detail View of a Campaign record you can access the inbuilt
Campaign response tracking by clicking the View Status button.

![Campaign
Status.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/4/4f/Campaign_Status.png)

On clicking this button you will be taken to the Status page for that
Campaign record. This page gives an overview of the Campaign details as
well as a graphical representation of your Campaign response including
the number of messages sent, bounced messages, how many viewers, opt
outs and how many clicked through links.

![Campaign Response

These fields are expanded further down the page and detailed on an
individual record level. These records can be added to a new Target List
by clicking the Add to Target List button. This allows you to create
new, more focussed Campaigns based on who has responded.

Campaign record. This page gives a graphical representation of your
Campaign Return on Investment, allowing you to easily visualise how your
organisation's money spent on the Campaign has translated into potential
business.

![Campaign ROI
Graph.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/16/Campaign_ROI_Graph.png)

## Cases


In SuiteCRM Cases are used to record interactions with Customers when
they ask for help or advice, for example in a Sales or Support function.
A Case can be created, updated when a User is working on it, assigned to
a colleague and closed when resolved. At each stage of the Case the User
can track and update the incoming and outgoing conversation thread so a
clear record of what has occurred is registered in the CRM. Cases can be
related to individual records such as Accounts, Contacts and Bugs.

## Summary


In this chapter we have covered the functionality of the core modules.
These modules allow the user to define and refine sales processes, with
the ability to record data in detail within the required module.

In the next chapter, we will cover the advanced modules within SuiteCRM.
These modules allow the user to manage further sales processes, create
automated workflows, design reports and more.

## Advanced Modules
=

By now, you should have a fundamental understanding of the SuiteCRM user
interface, basic modules, layouts, creating, searching and managing
records.

The next section of this User Guide covers in detail the Advanced CRM
modules. SuiteCRM has Advanced CRM modules which allow Users to further
enhance your Sales Force Automation Capabilities and improve business
processes.


## Advanced Open Sales


The first 'Suite' of advanced modules is AOS(Advanced Open Sales). The
various modules that are part of the AOS suite of modules allow you to
manage the Post-Opportunity Sales processes such as Quoting, Invoicing
and recurring Contracting. This functionality is made available to you
through the following modules:


-   Product Categories
-   Products
-   PDF Templates
-   Quotations
-   Invoices
-   Contracts

### AOS Settings

System Administrator users can alter the settings for AOS using the AOS
Settings page under the Advanced OpenSales panel within the Admin Panel.

![Image79.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/7/79/Image79.png)

You can customise the following settings within the AOS Settings:


-   Renewal Reminder Period – This defines how many days before the
    Contract End Date that a reminder call should be created.
-   Initial Invoice Number – Allows users to set the initial invoice
    number. For example 20001.
-   Initial Quote Number – Allows users to set the initial quote number.
    For example 456.
-   Enable Line Items Groups – If selected then users will be able to
    bundle line items into groups. If this is not selected then you will
    not be able to use the AOS Group functionality. *Note: This setting
    should be selected before using AOS – It is difficult to migrate
    from/to groups once Quotes/Invoices have been created.*
-   Add Tax to Line Total – If this is selected then the Tax will be
    added into the Line Total on Line Items. If this is not the selected
    the Line Total will not include Tax.

![Image80.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/f/f9/Image80.png)

Once configured, click 'Save' to apply your AOS Settings.

### Products Module

You can create Product records using the Products module. Creating
products allows users to select product lines when preparing Quotes
using AOS. The products module allows users to specify the Products
Name, Part Number, Category and Type. Additional fields for Products can
be added using Studio.

![Image81.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/0e/Image81.png)

The module also allows users to define a Cost and Price for the product.
Price is the selling price which will be used in the quoting process. A
related Contact can be associated to the product. This is the point of
contact with the supplier concerning this product. If you have an Image
of the product then this can be uploaded within the products record. A
URL to the products page on your website can also be specified.

### Products Categories Module

The Product Categories module allows Users to structure Products into a
hierarchical category structure. To create a Product Category record,
navigate to the Product Categories module and click the 'Create Product
Categories' button in the action bar.

![Image82.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/6/6b/Image82.png)

The Parent Category field is a relationship field to another Product
Categories record. If you check the 'Is Parent Category' field then this
signifies that the category is the highest level. Once selected you will
not be able to select a Parent Category using the relate field.

### PDF Templates

**Creating Templates**

AOS allows users to generate PDF documents and merge data from SuiteCRM
modules. You must however create a PDF template first.

![Image83.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/7/77/Image83.png)

This module provides a WYSIWYG interface to create dynamic PDF
templates. You must select a Type. This is the module you are building
the PDF Template for. By default the modules you can select are: Quotes
Invoices Accounts Contacts Leads

System Administrator users can extend this list by editing the
'pdf\_template\_type\_dom' using the drop down editor functionality.
Please note that the drop down 'Item Name' must be the name of the
module directory.

To insert fields into the Body of the template users will first select a
module. This will be the either the same module as the Type or a related
module to the Type module. This is selected using the first drop down on
the Insert Fields row.

![Image84.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/7/79/Image84.png)

This will populate the second drop down with all the fields found within
that module. Once you have selected the field you wish to insert, the
text field will populate with the field variable name. Click 'Insert' to
place this field into the Body of the template. If the Active check box
is selected then users will be able to generate PDFs from this template.
If it is not selected you will not.

**Loading Samples**

![Image85.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/bb/Image85.png)

AOS comes with seven pre-defined PDF templates to help you create your
own. These can be loaded by selecting the appropriate template from the
Load Sample drop down list.

![Image86.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/c/c3/Image86.png)

**Line Items**

When using a sample to create a template for Quotes or Invoices the Line
Items are formatted within a table. You can change the fields found in
this table as well as add or remove columns. Please note that if you are
creating the template from scratch you must format the Line Items
section as a table.

![Image87.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/0b/Image87.png)

**Margins**

At the bottom of the PDF Template Edit View, you can specify the margin
width for the PDF output.

![Image88.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/b/b8/Image88.png)

**Header and Footer**

Within the PDF Templates Edit View, you can also define a Header and a
Footer for your templates. These can be completed using the Header and
Footer text areas found below the Body text area.

![Image89.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/9/93/Image89.png)

**Generate Letter**

You can generate PDF documents for Accounts, Contacts and Leads using
the Generate Letter functionality.

![Image90.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/1a/Image90.png)

Clicking the 'Generate Letter' button found on these modules Detail View
will prompt a pop-up asking to select a template.

![Image91.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/e/ea/Image91.png)

The template selector pop-up will show all the active templates which
have the same Type as the module of the record. Clicking the template
name will generate a PDF document with date populated from the record
and it's related records. The Generate Letter functionality can also be
actioned from the List View. This allows you to select multiple records
and click the 'Generate Letter' button within the List View action menu.

![Image92.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/8/82/Image92.png)

The process for generating PDFs for Quotes, Invoices and Contracts is
described in your respective sections.

### Quotes Module

**Creating a Quote**

You can create a Quote by going to the Quotes module and clicking
'Create Quote' from within the actions bar. The first panel allows you
to specify details concerning the quote such as the Title, related
Opportunity, Stage and Payment Terms. The Quote Number field is
calculated automatically.

![Image93.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/56/Image93.png)

The second panel allows you to specify who the Quote is for by relating
an Account and Contact to the Quote. When you select the Account, the
Billing Address and Shipping Address are dynamically pulled from the
Account and populated into the fields on the Quote record.

![Image94.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/5b/Image94.png)

**Line Items with Groups**

The third panel allows users to specify the Quote Groups, Line Items and
the Currency. A Group is a collection of Line Items with its own Group
Total. A Line Item can be a Product Line or a Service Line. To add a
Quote Group, click the 'Add Group' button.

*Note: Add Group will be displayed if “Enable Line Item groups” is
selected in Admin.*

![Image95.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/a/a1/Image95.png)

This will display the Group, allowing you to insert a Group Name and add
a Product Line or Service Line. It will also display the Group Totals.

![Image96.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/4/45/Image96.png)

To add a Product Line, click the 'Add Product Line' button. This will
allow users to quote for Products from the Products module.

![Image97.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/2/2f/Image97.png)

To select a Product, you can start typing in the Product or Part Number
field which will provide a list of results similar to any relate field.
Alternatively click the arrow button next to the Part Number field. This
will display a pop-up window allowing you to select from a list of
Products.

![Image98.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/c/c9/Image98.png)

Once you have selected a Product, the List, Sale Price and Total will
populate automatically. You can change the Quality, add Discounts
(Percentage or Amount) and increase the Tax percentage. These will alter
the Sale Price, Total Price and Group Total fields. To add a Service
Line, click the 'Add Service Line' button. This will allow users to
quote for Services.

![Image99.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/0/03/Image99.png)

For Service Lines, you must specify the List price. This will populate
the Sale Price. Tax and Discounts can be added similarly to the Product
Line. AOS will keep a Grand Total for each Group.

![Image100.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/1f/Image100.png)

AOS will also keep a Grand Total for all Groups combined.

![image101.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image101.png)](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/index.php/MediaWiki)

The Shipping field allows you to add a shipping cost. The Shipping Tax
field allows you to add tax to this value. Once the Quote has been
compiled, click 'Save' to save the Quote.

Line Items without Groups

Creating Quotes without Groups is very similar to creating Quotes with
Groups. The only difference is you do not have to click 'Add Group'. You
simply 'Add Product Line' and 'Add Service Line' to the quote. Without
Groups you are cannot see the Group Total fields. You will only see the
Grand Total fields.

**Sending Quotations**

To output a Quote you can select one of following three buttons from the
Quote Detail View.

![image102.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image102.png)](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/index.php/MediaWiki)

AOS provides users with three methods of sending Quotes:


-   Print as PDF – Allows you to select a template and download or save
    a PDF of the Quote.
-   Email PDF – Allows you to select a template then directs you to the
    SuiteCRM email client 'Compose' screen. The Quote PDF will be
    attached to email and the email will be addressed to the related
    Contact of the Quote. This allows you to fill out the email body.
-   Email Quotation – This directs you to the SuiteCRM email client
    'Compose' screen. The email will be addressed to the related Contact
    of the Quote. There will be no attachment and the Quote will be
    displayed within the body of the email.

**Convert To Invoice**

With AOS you can convert Quotes to Invoices. This can be achieved by
clicking the 'Convert to Invoice' button on the Quote Detail View.

![image103.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image103.png)](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/index.php/MediaWiki)

This functionality will redirect users to the Edit View of an Invoice
record. Fields will be populated based on your Quote counterparts and
Line Items will be copied over. When you are ready to create the
Invoice, click the 'Save' button. Converting a Quote to an Invoice will
set the Invoice Status of the quote to 'Invoiced'.

**Create Contract**

As well as converting to an Invoice, AOS allows users to create a
Contract based on a Quote. This can be done by clicking the 'Create
Contract' button on the Quote Detail View.

![image104.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image104.png)](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/index.php/MediaWiki)

This will redirect you to the Edit View of a Contract record, pulling
through any appropriate fields from the Quote. This includes any Line
Items on the Quote.

### Invoices Module

**Creating an Invoice**

Creating an Invoice record is very similar to creating a Quote record.
You can create an Invoice by going to the Invoices module and clicking
'Create Invoice' from within the actions bar. The first panel allows you
to specify details about the Invoice such as Status and Due Date.

![image105.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image105.png)

The second panel allows you to specify who the Invoice is for by
relating an Account and Contact to the Invoice. When you select the
Account, the Billing Address and Shipping Address are dynamically pulled
from the Account and populated into the fields on the Invoice record.

![image106.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image106.png)

**Groups and Line Items**

AOS allows users to add Groups and Line Items to Invoices. This is
completed in the exact same way as Quotes. Please refer to Quotes
section for details on how to create Groups and Line Items.

Sending Invoices

To output an Invoice you can select one of following three buttons from
the Invoice Detail View.

![image107.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image107.png)

AOS provides users with three methods of sending Invoices:


-   Print as PDF – Allows users to select a template and download or
    save a PDF of the Invoice.
-   Email PDF – Allows users to select a template then directs you to
    the SuiteCRM email client 'Compose' screen. The Invoice PDF will be
    attached to email and the email will be addressed to the related
    Contact of the Invoice. This allows user to fill out the email body.
-   Email Invoice – This directs you to the SuiteCRM email client
    'Compose' screen. The email will be addressed to the related Contact
    of the Invoice. There will be no attachment and the Invoice will be
    displayed within the body of the email.

### Contracts Module

**Creating a Contract**

AOS allows users to create Contracts using the Contracts module.

![image108.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image108.png)

When the Contract is created the Renewal Reminder Date will populate
automatically based on the amount of days specified in the AOS Settings
in Admin. A Call will be scheduled and assigned to the Contract Manger
for this date.

**Groups and Line Items**

AOS allows users to add Groups and Line Items for Contracts. This is
completed in the exact same way as Quotes. Please refer to Quotes
section for details on how to create Groups and Line Items.

## Advanced Open Workflow


Advanced OpenWorkflow (AOW) is a module for SuiteCRM, allowing users to
create custom workflow processes. This module allows users to trigger
various system actions based on conditions from any SuiteCRM module.


### Creating a Workflow Process

You can create workflow processes by navigating to the 'WorkFlow' module
within SuiteCRM. Click the 'Create WorkFlow' button within the action
bar to start creating the process. The first panel allows users to set
up the workflow process.

![image109.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image109.png)

This allows you to specify the following:


-   Name – The name of the process.
-   Assigned To - The assigned user of the workflow process.
-   WorkFlow Module – A drop down list of all the modules found within
    the SuiteCRM instance. This is the module the workflow is run
    against. For example, When an Account is created/edited.
-   Status – Active or Inactive. Only active processes will run.
-   Run – Always, On Save or On Scheduler.
-   Run On – All Records, Modified Records or New Records.
-   Repeated Runs – If checked, the process will continue to run over
    and over. Ideally this should only be checked if one of the
    specified Actions negates (or will lead to the negation) of one of
    the specified Conditions.
-   Description – A description of the process.

### Conditions

Adding Conditions

Once set up, you can add conditions to a workflow process using the
conditions panel. This allows users to specify the criteria that should
trigger the workflow actions.

![image110.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image110.png)

To add a Condition Line you must click the 'Add Condition' button.

*Note: You must select your WorkFlow Module on the first panel before
adding a Condition Line.*

![image111.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image111.png)

You can have an unlimited amount of Condition Lines. To add another line
click the 'Add Condition' button again and it will appear. On the line
you will have four fields; Field, Operator, Type and Value.

Field and Operator

Field is a drop down which automatically populates with all the fields
found in the WorkFlow Module.

![image112.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image112.png)

The Field selected will determine the options available for Operator and
Type. If the field type is not a number or date then the operators
available will be 'Equal To' or 'Not Equal To'. For number and date
fields you can also choose from additional logical operators; 'Less
Than', 'Greater Than', 'Less Than or Equal To' or 'Greater Than or Equal
To'.

![image113.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image113.png)

**Condition Types**

You can specify workflow processes to trigger on different condition
types. These are as follows:

Value – This is used to directly compare the Field to a value. The value
type offered is dynamic to the field type of the Field selected. For
example, if the field type is a drop down then the value field type will
be the same drop down list.

![image114.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image114.png)

Field – This is used to action a workflow process when one field is
compared to another field in the record.

![image115.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image115.png)

Multiple – This can be selected if the Field is a drop down/multiselect.
This allows users to specify multiple values to action the workflow
from.

![image116.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image116.png)

Date – This allows you to specify the workflow to occur after/before an
amount of time from either another date field or 'Now'. For example,
when the start date of a call is 'Now + 10 minutes'. This can only be
used when the Field is a date field. The amount of time before or after
the date can be specified in Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks or Months.

![image117.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image117.png)

**Removing Conditions**

You can remove Condition Lines by clicking the '-' button on the left
hand side of the condition.

![image118.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image118.png)

### Actions

**Adding Actions**

Actions are defined in the third panel. These specify what events should
occur when the conditions have been met. You can add an Action by
clicking the 'Add Action' button.

![image119.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image119.png)

This will cause the Action Line to appear.

![image120.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image120.png)

From the Action Line you can Select Action and give it a Name. The
actions available are; 'Create Record', 'Modify Record' and 'Send
Email'. You can specify an unlimited amount of actions for each workflow
process.

**Create Record**

If you select 'Create Record' you will be prompted to select a Record
Type. This is the module type of the record you are looking to create.

![image121.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image121.png)

Once selected you can add fields or relationships to this record using
the 'Add Field' and 'Add Relationship' buttons.

![image122.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image122.png)

When Adding fields the first drop down in the line will populate with
all the fields from that module. The second drop down allows you to
specify how the value for that field is going to be derived. For most
cases the options are as follows:


-   Value – This will allow you to input the value directly using the
    same field type as the field selected.
-   Field – This will make the field the same value as a field found in
    the WorkFlow Module.
-   Date – Only selectable if the field is a date field. This will allow
    you to specify the value as an amount of time after/before another
    date field or 'Now'.

![image123.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image123.png)

Selecting the 'Assigned-To' field also gives you more options. As well
as by value and field you can assign a user by:

Round Robin – This will select each user in turn.

Least Busy – This will select you with the least amount of records
assigned to you for that module.

Random – This will select a random user.

For each of the above options you can choose if you want you to be
selected from all users or users from a specific role. If you have the
SecuritySuite module installed you can additionally choose if you want
you to be selected from all users from a particular Security Group or
all users from a particular security group with a particular role.

![image124.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image124.png)

When adding relationships you must select the related module from the
drop down list then select the record that the new record should be
related to.

![image125.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image125.png)

*Note: You must selected the related module using the arrow button – The
auto completion on the text field is not currently developed.*

**Modify Record**

This provides the same functionality as 'Create Record' but instead of
creating a new record you are modifying the record which met the
conditions of the workflow process. With this action you can modify any
field found within the record or you can add a relationship to another
record. This is completed in the same way as 'Create Record' except you
are not required to specify the Record Type.

**Send Email**

The 'Send Email' action allows users to create workflow processes which
will send an email based on an template to individuals. Using this
action there are four different types of recipient.

Email – This will send an email to a specific email address. You must
specify the email address and the email template.

![image126.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image126.png)

Record Email – This will send an email to the primary email address
specified on the record which actioned the workflow process. This can
only be used if the record has an email field such as Accounts and
Contacts. For this option you only need to specify the template.

![image127.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image127.png)

User – This will send the email to a specified Users email address. You
must specify the recipient user and the template of the email.

![image128.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image128.png)

Related Field – This will send an email to the primary email address
specified on a related modules record. In this case you must specify the
related module (From a drop down list) and the email template.

![image129.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image129.png)


#### [Calculate Fields]{#Calculate_Fields .mw-headline}

If you select 'Calculate Fields' from the Action dropdown the Calculate
Fields user interface will be loaded after a second and looks like the
picture below.

[![AddActionCF\_updated.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/5a/AddActionCF_updated.png)


**Calculate Fields - Adding parameters**

It is possible to add parameters to the formulas by using the dropdown
in the Parameters section of the Calculate Fields’s user interface. The
dropdown contains all of the (basic and custom) fields which belongs to
the module selected in the basic fields section.

To add a parameter, select the field from the dropdown and click on the
Add parameter button. After this action, a new line appears in the
parameter table with the name of the field and the given identifier.

For some fields (dropdowns and multi-selects) an additional dropdown
shown up where the user can select if the raw or the formatted value
should be used in Calculated Fields. The raw format means the value
which is stored in the database and the formatted value means the label
for that database value.

To remove a parameter from the table, simply click on the minus button
in the row of the parameter. Be aware, that if you remove a parameter,
all of the identifiers are recalculated, so the identifiers could change
for fields!

[![AddActionCF\_updated1.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/f/f2/AddActionCF_updated1.png)

The identifier is used to reference this field when the user creates the
formula. For example all appearances of the {P0} identifier will be
replaced with the Account’s name in the formula. All parameters are like
{Px} where x is the sequential order of the parameter. The amount of the
parameters is not limited.

**Calculate Fields - Adding relation parameters**

Relation parameters are very similar to the regular parameters, the only
difference is that the user first selects an entity which is in a
one-to-one or one-to-many relationship with the actual entity.

To add a relation parameter, select the relation first, and then select
the field from the connected entity and push the Add relation parameter
button. After this action, a new line appears in the relation parameter
table with the name of the relationship, the name of the field and the
given identifier.

As for parameters for some relation parameter fields (dropdowns and
multi-selects) an additional dropdown shown up where the user can select
if the raw or the formatted value should be used in Calculate Fields.

To remove a relation parameter from the table, simply click on the minus
button in the row of the relation parameter. Be aware, that if you
remove a relation parameter, all of the identifiers are recalculated, so
the identifiers could change for fields!

[![AddAction\_updated2.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/8/86/AddAction_updated2.png)

The identifier is used to reference this field when the user creates the
formula. For example all appearances of the {R0} identifier will be
replaced with the creator user‘s username in the formula. All relation
parameters are like {Rx} where x is the sequential order of the relation
parameter. The amount of the relation parameters is not limited.

**Calculate Fields - Creating formula for a field**

In the Formulas part of the user interface the user can add formulas for
fields of the actual entity.

To add a formula, select a field from the dropdown first and then push
the Add formula button. After this action, a new line appears in the
formula table with the name of the field and with the place for the
formula.

To remove a formula from the table, simply click on the minus button in
the row of the formula.

[![AddActionCF\_updated3.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/4/40/AddActionCF_updated3.png)

The formula is a textbox where the user can write the formulas. The
module evaluates the formula on the given time (on save, on scheduler
run or both) and fills the selected field with the evaluated value.

The formula can contain any text (with full UTF-8 support), but only the
function parts (functions with parameters between ‘{‘ and ‘}’) are
evaluated. For example and with the parameters added in the previous
sections, if we fill the formula like: Account {P0} created by user name
{R0}, then the description field will have the following value after
save: Account My Account created by user name MyUser (implying the
account’s name is My Account and the creator user’s username is MyUser).

The Calculate Fields has many built-in functions which allows the user
to build complex formulas to achieve various goals. These functions are
described in the next section.

**Calculate Fields - Usable functions**

As it is mentioned above, all of the functions are wrapped between ‘{‘
and ‘}’ signs, and they look like {functionName(parameter1; parameter2;
…)}. The count of the parameters are different for the different
functions. The module evaluates the functions and changes them with
their result in the formula.

The functions can be embedded into each other (using a result of a
function as a parameter for another function) like in this example:

``` {style="white-space: pre; white-space: -moz-pre; white-space: -pre; white-space: -o-pre;"}
{power({subtract({divide({add({multiply(10; 2)}; 12)}; 8)}; 1)}; 2)}
```

This function is the formalised look of the following mathematical
expression:

``` {style="white-space: pre; white-space: -moz-pre; white-space: -pre; white-space: -o-pre;"}
((((10 * 2) + 12) / 8) – 1)2
```

The functions are divided to six groups. These groups are described in
the next section of the document.


##### [Logical Functions]{#Logical_Functions .mw-headline}

##### [Date functions]{#Date_functions .mw-headline}

There are several date functions implemented in Calculate Fields, so the
user can manipulate dates in many ways. Most of the functions uses a
format parameter, which is used to set the result of the functions
formatted as the user wants to. The options for these formats are
equivalent with the PHP format parameters:

##### [Control Functions]{#Control_Functions .mw-headline}

There is only one control function implemented in Calculate Fields so
far, but this function ensures that the user can write very complex
formulas with conditions. Since the functions can be embedded in each
other, the user can write junctions with many branches.

**ifThenElse**

Signature
{ifThenElse(condition; trueBranch;
falseBranch)}

Parameters
condition: logical value
trueBranch: any expression
falseBranch: any expression
Description
Selects one of the two branches depending
on **condition**

Returns
**trueBranch** if **condition** is
true, **falseBranch** otherwise

Example call
{ifThenElse({equal(1; 1)}; 1 equals 1; 1
not equals 1)} returns 1 equals 1

##### [Counters]{#Counters .mw-headline}

There are several counters implemented in Calculate Fields which can be
used in various scenarios.

The counters sorted into two groups:

1.  **Global counters:** Counters which are incremented every time an
    affected formula is evaluated
2.  **Daily counters:** Counters which resets every day. (Starting
    from 1)

In this chapter we assume that the counters current value is 4, so the
incremented value will be 5 with the given format.

##### [Example]{#Example .mw-headline}

**Calculate monthly fee for an opportunity**

**Use Case**

The user would like to calculate a monthly fee of an opportunity to a
custom field by dividing the amount of the opportunity by the duration.

**Setup**

Our opportunities module has a dropdown field called Duration with
values: (database value in brackets) 6 months \[6\], 1 year \[12\], 2
years \[24\]. There is also a currency field called Monthly.

**Workflow**

Go to WorkFlow module and create a new WorkFlow. Set the base options
like the following:

  -
  **Name:** as you wish     **WorkFlow Module:** Opportunities
  **Status:** Active        **Run:** Only on save
  **Run on:** All records   **Repeated runs:** checked
  -

[![ExampleCF\_orig.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/4/43/ExampleCF_orig.png)

We do not create any conditions, since we would like the WorkFlow to run
on all opportunities.

Now, add an action and select Calculate Fields from the dropdown.

Then, add two fields from Opportunities as parameters. First, select
Opportunity amount (amount) and add it as a parameter (it will be {P0})
then select Duration and the raw value option from the data type
dropdown and add it as parameter two (it will be {P1}). There is no need
to add any relational parameters for this formula.

Now, add a formula for the monthly field and fill the textbox with the
following formula:

``` {style="white-space: pre; white-space: -moz-pre; white-space: -pre; white-space: -o-pre;"}
{divide({P0}; {P1})}
```

So the whole action should look like this:

[![ExampleCF\_updated1.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/13/ExampleCF_updated1.png)

Save the WorkFlow and create a new Opportunity:

[![ExampleCF\_orig2.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/5/5a/ExampleCF_orig2.png)

As you can see, we did not even add the monthly field to the EditView,
because we don’t want to force the user to make calculations. Save the
Opportunity and check the results on the DetailView:

Advanced OpenWorkflow allows users to audit your processes. In the
Detail View of each WorkFlow record there is a sub-panel called
'Processed Flows'.

## Advanced Open Cases with Portal


### Introduction

Advanced OpenPortal (AOP) is an enhancement to the case management
module in SuiteCRM. There is also a Joomla component. AOP extends the
core cases functionality and enhances mechanisms for contacts to update
cases.

This module allows contacts held within SuiteCRM to:


-   Retrieve emails regarding updates to your Cases
-   Create Cases by emailing a defined support address
-   Update Cases by replying to Case emails

The module allows SuiteCRM users to: Add updates to Cases View a
threaded log of all updates Retrieve email notifications when a contact
adds an update to a Case Create Joomla users from a Contact The AOP
Joomla component connects a Joomla site to the SuiteCRM instance. This
allows SuiteCRM Contacts to: View a list of your Cases online Create new
Cases online Reply to existing cases View your case details including a
threaded log of all updates

Emails Advanced OpenPortal (AOP) uses the standard SuiteCRM
functionality to send emails and create cases from inbound emails.
Details on how to configure your outgoing email settings can be found
here. Details on how to set up a group email account which will
automatically generate cases can be found here.


### Installation & Configuration

System Administrator users can configure the settings by accessing the
AOP settings through the admin panel.

![image145.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image145.png)


Here you can enable or disable the AOP functionality, configure the
Joomla URL, set the case distribution method, “email from” details and
the different email templates.

To install the Joomla AOP component, use the Joomla Extension Manager.
Once installed you must configure the SuiteCRM URL and a valid SuiteCRM
username and password. This can be done by navigating to Components →
advancedopen-portal.

![image146.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image146.png)

Once you have configured the Joomla component you can add two new Main
Menu items to your Joomla portal. These are:


-   List Cases - This shows a list of all Cases that the Contact has
    logged. This page also provides a search mechanism to filter cases.
-   New Case – This page will allow Contacts to create Cases in SuiteCRM
    from the Joomla portal.

![image147.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image147.png)

### Using Advanced OpenPortal

**Creating a Portal User**

To create a Portal User a SuiteCRM User must first create a Contact for
the Portal User using the standard SuiteCRM functionality. Once created
you must click the 'Create Portal User' button. This can be found at the
top left hand side of the Contact record Detail View.

*Note: If you have action menus enabled the button will be within the
action menu.*

![image148.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image148.png)](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image1408png)

Once clicked, a new user will be created in Joomla and the Contact will
be sent your portal credentials via email.

**Creating a Case via the Portal**

Portal Users can create a new Case by going to the New Case page on the
portal website.

![image149.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image149.png)

From here Portal Users can enter the details of your issue and attach
any supporting documents. The dropdown values are dynamically pulled
from the SuiteCRM instance and thus can be edited using the drop down
editor tool within SuiteCRM.

*Note: This feature does use the Joomla cache so please clear cache
after an update has been made. When the case is ready to be logged,
click the 'Save' button. This will create the Case within SuiteCRM*.

**Viewing Cases via the Portal**

Portal Users can view a list of all your Cases using the List Cases
page. This will also allow you to filter your search by State (All, Open
or Closed) or by keyword. When searching by keyword it will search the
'Number', 'Subject', 'Status', 'Created' and 'Last Update' fields to
find your result.

![image150.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image150.png)

To view more information on the case and to add updates then Portal
Users can click the 'Subject' of case.

![image151.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image151.png)

From the case view Portal Users can view all the external updates added
to the case from both Joomla and SuiteCRM. This is displayed in a
threaded format showing who updated the case Any attached files to
updates will also be accessible from this view. When a Portal User
updates a case the assigned SuiteCRM user of the case will be notified
by email.

**Creating and Updating Cases from SuiteCRM**

You can create and update Cases from SuiteCRM. To add an update to an
existing record Users will add text to the 'Update' field within the
case Detail View and click 'Save'. This will publish the update to the
portal and send an email to any Contacts related to the Case.

![image152.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image152.png)

If Users check the 'Internal Update' field then the update will appear
in SuiteCRM only. It will not appear in Joomla and the Contact will not
be emailed.

![image153.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image153.png)

The Case Detail View will show the full threaded update log.

![image154.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image154.png)

Additional Contacts can be added to the Case using the Contacts sub
panel. All emails exchanged between the system, the contact and you will
be attached to the History sub-panel. Any documents attached to the case
using the Portal are held as Notes within this sub-panel.

**Status Drop Down**

Within Cases, you can specify both a State and a Status value. The State
determines if the Case is Open or Closed. Depending on the State you
will be offered different statuses. You can amend these statuses using
the Dropdown Editor Tool within the Admin Developer Tools. When adding a
new Status you must define the Item Name as “&lt;parent dropdown item
name&gt;\_ItemName” For example “Open\_New” or “Closed\_Rejected”. All
values with an Item Name prefixed with “Open\_” will show when the state
is Open, similarly all with the prefix “Closed\_” will show when the
state is closed.

## Advanced Open Reports


Advanced Open Reports (AOR) is the reporting module within SuiteCRM. AOR
can be accessed by clicking the 'Reports' link within the navigation
menu. The reporting module allows users to report on CRM data from any
module and has many features to display key information quickly.

### Creating Reports

To create a report, hover over the Reports module on the navigation bar
and select 'Create Report'.

![image170.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image170.png)

You will be presented with the report Edit View. To obtain a list of
fields to add to the report, you have to select a module from the Report
Module drop down.

![image171.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image171.png)

**Adding Fields**

Once you have selected a Report Module, the list of fields available
will display on the left panel. You can add fields to the 'Fields'
section of the report by expanding the module you wish to select fields
from and then drag and drop those fields into the field section.

![image172.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image172.png)

![image173.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image173.png)

Once you have added fields to a Report, there are multiple options to
configure for those fields:


-   Display – True or false option. Allows you to specify whether this
    field should be displayed on the report, or hidden. Users may wish
    to add fields to perform a function/sort/group/total but may not
    wish to show this on the Report.
<! >

-   Link – True or false option. Allows you to make the field a link.
    Setting this option to true will hyperlink the field on the Detail
    View of the report, allowing you to click on the record. This will
    navigate you to the appropriate record. For example, linking the
    Opportunity Name will take you to the Detail View of that
    Opportunity.
<! >

-   Label – This is the label that will be displayed for the
    Column/Field on the Report. You can change the label from the
    default to any alphanumerical value.
<! >

-   Function - Provides five options: Count, Minimum, Maximum, Sum and
    Average. Allows you to perform functions on alphanumerical fields.
    Users may wish to calculate the average Opportunity Amount, or Count
    total Opportunities at a given Sales Stage.
<! >

-   Sort – Ascending or Descending. Allows you to select whether to sort
    the field/column descending or ascending. This can be done for all
    fields.
<! >

-   Group – True or false option. Allows you to group by this field. For
    example, you may wish to group by Sales Stage when reporting on an
    Opportunity.
<! >

-   Total – Provides three options: Count, Sum and Average. This allows
    users to perform total calculations on numerical fields. This is
    useful for financial reporting such as the total value of all
    Opportunities at a given Sales Stage.
**Adding Conditions**

Once you have added the fields to your Report, you can add condition
lines to the Report. You can add conditions with the same procedure as
adding fields. Using the drag and drop functionality, you can drag
fields into the 'Conditions' area which will add the field and allow you
to specify the condition for that field.

### Charts

You can add charts to Reports. Charts provide a visual representation of
the Report data to you. In some scenarios, or for particular users,
visual aids such as charts can assist quicker analysis and better
understanding.

**Chart Types**

There are six types of chart that the user can select to display Report
data. These are:

-   Pie Chart
-   Bar Chart
-   Line Chart
-   Radar Chart
-   Stacked Bar
-   Grouped Bar

To add a chart, you can click the 'Add Chart' button, below the
Conditions section within the Report Edit View.

![image174.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image174.png)

Once you click add chart, you will be presented with the option to
specify the following information:

-   Title – Allows the user to specify the title for the chart. This
    will show on the Detail View of the Report and also on the dashlet
    chart.
-   Type – This allows the user to select from one of the six chart
    types detailed above.
-   X Axis – Allows the user to select the column that should be used
    for the X Axis.
-   Y Axis – Allows the user to select the column that should be used
    for the Y Axis.

![image175.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image175.png)

Once you have specified the chart details, save the Report. This will
display the chart on the Detail View of the Report, below the list of
records returned.

![Image176.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/1/1c/Image176.png)

### Reports Dashlets

You can display a Report within a dashlet. It is possible to view
multiple Report results as you can add multiple Report dashlets and
select different Reports within each dashlet. To do this, add the
Reports dashlet to your homepage.

![image177.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image177.png)

![Image178.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/8/82/Image178.png)

to display within the dashlet. To do this, click the pencil icon to edit
the dashlet.

![image179.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image179.png)

This allows the user to select the Report they wish to display within
the dashlet.

![image180.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image180.png)

Once you have selected the Report, click 'Save'. This will update your
Reports dashlet to show the results of the Report.

![image181.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image181.png)

To do this, edit your Report dashlet and select the 'Only use charts'
option. This will then list all charts you have created for this Report.

![image182.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image182.png)

Select a chart or multiple charts and click 'Save'. This will display
the results in the chart selected.

![image183.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image183.png)

### Scheduled Reports

You can schedule reports to be automatically run and emailed to the
required Contact(s). This allows users to schedule reports to be sent to
Managers or Team Leads either Daily, Weekly or Monthly. To create a
Scheduled Report, you can click the 'Create' option within the Scheduled
Reports Sub-panel on the Detail View of the Report. You can also select
existing Scheduled Reports to relate to the Report.

![image184.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image184.png)

Once you have clicked 'Create', there are options to set for the
Scheduled Report. Give the Scheduled Report a relevant name. In this
example, we will use 'Daily Opportunites Report for Managers'.

![image185.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image185.png)

You can select the 'Advanced' option for report scheduling. This will
provide a cron notation style option. This is best suited for System

Reschedule pop-up using the drop down editor. The drop down list used is
called 'call\_reschedule\_dom'.

## Summary


In this chapter we have covered the functionality of the advanced
modules. These modules have a very specific purpose - enabling users to
improve processes and efficiently report on and manage data.

In the next chapter, we will cover some third party modules which are
part of the SuiteCRM product. These third party modules provide
additional functionality to you such as teams and location mapping.

## Security Suite(Groups)


Security Suite allows control of what users can access. It allows
restricting sensitive data in SuiteCRM to specific teams (groups).
SecuritySuite comes loaded with options which allow you to configure it
to meet your exact needs. Choose from a number of automatic assignment
options to ensure that your users can always access the data that you
need.

## Create Groups


System Administrators can add groups and roles or set up Security Groups
preferences in Security Suite Settings found at the top of the Admin
page.

![Image193a.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/images/d/de/Image193a.png)

## Allow Non-admins to Create Groups


System Administrators can allow non-admin users to add groups to
records. This can be done by doing the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Configure Tabs. Add Security Groups to the displayed
    tabs.
2.  Run Repair Roles, within Admin-&gt;Repair, to be able to assign
    rights to Security Groups.
3.  Edit role(s) to Enable Security Groups Management.
4.  Edit role(s) to set List to All or Group for Security Groups
    Management as desired.

## Configure SecuritySuite Settings


SecuritySuite is very configurable and allows for support near every
possible situation. Because of that there may be a learning curve and
some time required to understand what each option does and how it may be
used for your specific needs. You can find the settings page by going to
Admin-&gt;SecuritySuite Settings.

## Groups Setup


There are 3 key steps to setting up Groups so that you work correctly.

1.  Create a group for each team of users and add the appropriate users
    to the group.
2.  Create a role and select Group for the access level for every
    appropriate cell in the grid. Assign that role to each group
3.  Add the groups to records in your SuiteCRM instance. You can use the
    Mass Assign on the List View to do this. Going forward the groups
    will automatically inherit based on your SecuritySuite Settings. You
    can also use logic hooks, workflow, or do a direct database insert
    into the securitygroups\_records table if doing a one-time initial
    setup.

If your users should only typically see their own records then the role
assigned to the group would be configured to have Owner only rights. A
manager who is a part of the group, but who should see be able to see
all records in the group would have a role directly assigned to you
record that gives Group access.

For more help check out:

-   [Example of a Typical
    Setup](https://www.sugaroutfitters.com/docs/securitysuite/example-of-a-typical-setup)
-   [Introduction
    Video](https://www.sugaroutfitters.com/docs/securitysuite/introduction-video)

Roles determine what a user can do with a record once they have access
to it.

1.  Create the roles
2.  Edit role(s) to Enable Security Groups Management
3.  Edit role(s) to set List to All or Group for Security Groups
    Management as desired

## A Typical Hierarchy Setup


Although SecuritySuite can handle any organizational structure, the most
common scenario it is used for is one where the owner can sell
everything, managers can see both their own records and those of their
team, and team members can only see their own records.

### The Scenario

This company has 2 sales teams; East and West. The owner, Jill, should
be able to see everything. The East Sales team is lead by Will and Sarah
leads the West Sales team. Both of them should see everything just in
your own respective teams. The rest of the Sales Reps in each teams
should only be allowed to see your own records.

### Set up the Groups

1.  Create a group called East Sales
2.  Add Will and the Sales Reps
3.  Create a group called West Sales
4.  Add Sarah and the Sales Reps

### Set up the Roles

1.  Create a role called Everything and set the rights to All.*Tips and
    Tricks: Click the header in any column on the role grid and you can
    set the rights for the whole column at one time*
2.  Assign the Everything role directly to Jill's user account
3.  Create a role called Group Only and set the rights for everything to
    Group
4.  Assign the Group role directly to Will and Sarah
5.  Create a role called Owner Only and set the rights for everything to
    Owner
6.  Assign the Owner Only role to the East Sales and West Sales groups

### Assign the Groups

This instance already has some existing Leads so we will assign them to
the appropriate groups.

1.  Go to the Leads List View and search for the Leads that should
    belong to the East Sales group
2.  Check the appropriate Leads, in the Mass Assign panel choose East
    Sales, and click "Assign"
3.  Repeat for the West Sales team

*Note: Going forward the groups will be automatically inherited by any
Calls, Contacts, Notes, etc that get added based on the SecuritySuite
Settings that are configured. If the SuiteCRM instance is already loaded
with lots of data at the time of starting with SecuritySuite then there
may be some initial work to be done to add those groups to the related
records. The Mass Assign functionality on the List View can be used or
direct database insertion into the securitygroups\_records table. See
existing data in that table for how to format the data. This will
require SQL knowledge if you want to go that route.*

### Check the Settings

These settings determine how SecuritySuite functions. In the Group
Inheritance Rules panel the defaults of "Inherit from Created By User",
"Inherit from Assigned To User", and "Inherit from Parent Record" will
work perfectly in this scenario.

Any Lead that gets created will automatically have groups assigned to it
based on who created it and who gets assigned to it. If a Call is
created for a Lead then the Call will inherit the groups from the Lead
record (parent record) along with inheriting the groups from the created
by user and the assigned to user.

Another key setting is "Strict Rights". In the scenario above the
default settings will cause the links on the List View for the team
Leads to show with no link for records that are assigned to your group.
In many cases you will want to uncheck "Strict Rights" so that you can
assign groups in the manner described in this doc.

### That's it!

The hardest part is always the initial setup. Once you have things
configured and figured out it will just run on its own.

Have a more complicated structure? Apply the same principles here for
each additional level of hierarchy that you may have. The key is to
create a group at the lowest levels of the structure and then work your
way back up.

## Advanced Options


SuiteCRM System Administrators can configure many advanced options for
Security Suite. This allows you to control various access/rights,
inheriting of records, filters and more.

![image194.png](https://suitecrm.com/wiki/media/image194.png)


### Additive Rights

User gets greatest rights of all roles assigned to you or user's
group(s)

### Strict Rights

If a user is a member of several groups only the respective rights from
the group assigned to the current record are used.

### New User Group Popup

When creating a new user show the SecurityGroups popup to assign you to
a group(s).

### User Role Precedence

If any role is assigned directly to a user that role should take
precedence over any group roles.

### Filter User List

Non-admin users can only assign to users in the same group(s)

### Use Popup Select

When a record is created by a user in more than one group popup a group
selection screen otherwise inherit that one group. Inheritance rules
will only be used for non-user created records (e.g. Workflows, etc).

### Use Creator Group Select

Adds a panel to a record creation screen if a user is a member of more
than one inheritable group that allows a user to select one or more
groups that you belongs to that should be associated with the newly
created record. If a user is in just one group the normal inheritance
rules will instead be applied.

*Note: The new record will still inherit from the Assigned To user or
Parent record if these options are set. This setting only overrides the
Created By setting.*

### Shared Calendar - Hide Restricted

By default users can see when other users are busy on the Shared
Calendar. Even if you doesn't have rights to the meeting, call, etc. It
will display on the calendar, but you cannot view more details unless
you have rights to that specific calendar item. By setting this option
you cannot see these items on the Shared Calendar; only items that you
actually has rights to.

The record will inherit all the groups assigned to you who created it.

associated with the contact.

### Default Groups for New Records

Set groups that should always be attached when a specific module is
created.
