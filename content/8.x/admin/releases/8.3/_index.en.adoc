== 8.3.0

_Released 16/05/2023_

=== icon:box-open[] Assets

* https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM-Core/releases/tag/v8.3.0[GitHub - Download]

===  icon:check[] Release Notes

==== System Requirement Changes

{{% notice warning %}}
The minimum php version has been updated to php 7.4.
{{% /notice %}}

To visit the SuiteCRM 8.3.x Compatibility Matrix please see link:../../compatibility-matrix/[here.]

==== Backward Incompatible Changes

{{% notice warning %}}
There has been a BREAKING change update to the `Process Handler Interface`.
{{% /notice %}}

The `Process Handler Interface` now has the additional function `getRequiredACls` and thus any extension using this interface
will need to be updated accordingly.

==== New Dev Package

This release includes a new `SuiteCRM-8.3.0-dev.zip` dev package, which is available via https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM-Core/releases/tag/v8.3.0[Github.]

This package is meant to help in the development of frontend extensions.

The only difference between the base package and the dev package, is that the dev package includes the `dist` folder.

Including the `dist` folder should remove the need to rebuild the core frontend code.

Please check the following pages for more information:

* link:../../../developer/developer-getting-started[Developer Getting Started guide]
* link:../../../developer/extensions/extension-structure[Extension Structure guide]

===== Upgrading

{{% notice info %}}
If you wish to upgrade from 8.0.x / 8.1.x to a more current release, please read the following
link:../../installation-guide/upgrading[Upgrade Documentation.]
{{% /notice %}}



==== icon:lock[] Security

* CVE: Pending - Stored XSS Vulnerability
* CVE: Pending - Improper Access Control
* CVE: Pending - Improper Access Control

==== icon:star[] Enhancements

===== Notifications

Notifications are now available in SuiteCRM 8, for the following activities:

* Meetings
* Calls

Therefore, if you are invited/assigned to one of the above, you will receive the notification and any subsequent reminders.
For more information on using the Notification features, please see link:../../../features/notifications[here.]

image:Notifications-Open.png[Notifications]

===== Subpanel Filters

When viewing Subpanels, you are now able to filter the results to locate the records you are interested in.
To enable the Filter option, you need to add it via the 'subpaneldefs.php'.  For further information on how to do this,
please see link:../../../features/subpanel-filtering[here.]

image:Filter-Full-Panel.png[Subpanel Filter]

===== Load More

Previously in SuiteCRM 8, to view additional records on Listview, Subpanels and Pop up Record List you would need to use the paging options.

However, you can now choose to 'Load More' meaning the records all display on the one page, making it easier to scroll up
and down the list of records, rather than paging back and forth.

To find out how to switch this on and configure the settings, please see link:../../../features/load-more[here.]

image:Load-More-Full.png[Load More]

===== Admin Page

SuiteCRM 8.3 now has a new administration page.

image:Admin-Panel-Top.png[Admin Panel]

image:Admin-Panel-Highlighted.png[Admin Panel Highlighted]

SuiteCRM 8.3 now has the ability to select any admin option from the NEW multi-menu.

image:Admin-Panel-Scheduler.png[Admin Panel Scheduler]

To see more information or to read more about the options within the admin panel please see link:../../administration-panel/administration-panel/[here.]

===== Hidden Column Display Button

SuiteCRM 8 now has the ability to see selected columns that do not appear on listview.

image:ListView.png[ListView.png]

After Selecting the `Columns` action we see:

image:Date-Create-CC.png[Date-Create-CC.png]

We have the `Date Created` selected, however it's not shown on the listview.

Any fields that are not shown on the list can be seen by selecting the three dots to the left of the record on the view.
