==== icon:code[] Backward Incompatible Changes

* **APP_SECRET env property is now required**
** For new installations a random APP_SECRET will be generated during the install process. For upgrades a migration has been added to generate a random APP_SECRET.

* **Move to Symfony runtime**
** SuiteCRM is now using Symfony runtime, core SuiteCRM code on index.php has been moved to `core/backend/Composer/Runtime/autoload_runtime.template`

* **Migration from annotations to attributes**
** Annotations have been replaced with attributes. They have been disabled in symfony configuration and the `doctrine/annotations` dependency has been removed.

* **Data Providers and Data Persisters have been deprecated**
** With Api Platform 3.2, Data Providers and Data Persisters have been replaced with StateProvider and StateProcessor.

* **Graphql Record and RecordList API response structure updated**
** With Api Platform 3.2 the graphql response structure changed. E.g. response now return `recordList` attribute instead of `getRecordList`-.

* **Graphql resolver interfaces path has changed**
** All the resolvers have been updated to use the new `QueryItemResolverInterface`.

* **ExtensionAssetCacheWarmupDecorator has been replaced with an extra cache warmer**
** Symfony now supports adding extra warmers. The decorator has been replaced with an extra cache warmer.

* **Legacy Session swapping removed**
** Legacy handlers and loading of legacy imports have been updated to remove the need for doing session swapping. Only one session cookie will be used from now on, the `LEGACYSESSID` has been removed.

* **Symfony Commands now require the usage of AsCommand attribute**
** All core commands have been updated to use the new AsCommand attribute.

* **Session injectable dependency replaced with RequestStack**
** It is no longer possible to pass the `Session` through Symfony dependency injection, `RequestStack` should be used instead. Core code has been updated to support this.

* **Authentication configuration has been updated**

* **SAML dependency replaced and configuration updated**
** SAML `Hslavich` dependency has been replaced with `Nbgrp`.
** Base SAML configurations have been updated.
** New SAML env options have been added to allow configuring SAML just from the env files.

* **Usages of Doctrine DBAL execute method have been updated**
** Doctrine DBAL execute method has been deprecated, usages have been updated to use alternatives.
