SuiteCRM is now using Symfony v6.4 and Api Platform 3.2. This brings some system requirement updates and breaking changes.

** SuiteCRM is now using Symfony runtime, core SuiteCRM code on index.php has been moved to `core/backend/Composer/Runtime/autoload_runtime.template`

* **Migration from annotations to attributes**

* **Symfony Commands now require the usage of AsCommand attribute**
** All core commands have been updated to use the new AsCommand attribute.

* **Session injectable dependency replaced with RequestStack**
** It is no longer possible to pass the `Session` through Symfony dependency injection, `RequestStack` should be used instead. Core code has been updated to support this.

* **Authentication configuration has been updated**

* **SAML dependency replaced and configuration updated**
** SAML `Hslavich` dependency has been replaced with `Nbgrp`.
** Base SAML configurations have been updated.
