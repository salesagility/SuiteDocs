===== Known Issues
* After changing "User Language" via your user profile:
** If an Admin updates another user's "User Language" value, and that user then logs in with different language chosen at Login, this can cause issues with showing the correct Language labels
** If a user updates their "User Language" value on their Profile, Admin users may not see the correct language selected on that User's Profile.
** If a user updates their "User Language" value on their Profile, some User Profile Action labels are not updating
** Sometimes, when changing Language, the Navbar Menu labels are not updating correctly
* The above issues should mostly be resolved with a hard refresh or a Repair and Rebuild

* If no timezone value is set on CLI install, or user bean Save() function is called, UTC is set as preference

* *On ListView Filter Panel:*
** Hitting `Enter` will apply the currently defined criteria and the search.
** When saving a filter, hitting `Enter` will save the filter and search.

====== 2. Date fields will now show the pop-up calendar when click on the input like they do when the calendar icon is clicked.

====== 3. Listview Column Resizing

* In order to show more rows on the screen, the ListView column padding has been reduced and the column width has been set to dynamically adjust.

====== 4. Enum component is now using regular dropdowns instead of the chips component

====== 5. Relate field component has been re-implemented
