[[introduction]]
1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[what-is-suitecrm]]
What is SuiteCRM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The story of https://www.suitecrm.com[SuiteCRM] starts with SugarCRM.
SugarCRM was founded in 2004 and consisted of an open source version
(called Community Edition) and various paid for versions. However
trouble started brewing when it appeared that SugarCRM would not be
releasing a Community Edition of SugarCRM 7 and would be providing
limited, if any, updates to the Community Edition.

Enter SuiteCRM. SalesAgility forked Community Edition to create SuiteCRM
and also added various open source plugins to add improved
functionality.

[[this-book]]
This book
^^^^^^^^^

This book is intended for developers who are familiar (or at least
acquainted) with using SuiteCRM but want to perform their own
customisations. SuiteCRM is a large and mature piece of software so it
is impractical for a book to cover all aspects of the software. I’ve
tried to add the most important parts which should allow you to make the
changes you need in 99% of situations. There is a further resources
chapter at the end of this book to help out in those 1% of cases. With
that being said if you feel there is anything important I have left out
(or worse, anything incorrect in the book) please let me know. I can be
contacted at http://www.jsmackin.co.uk[JSMackin.co.uk].

[[reading-this-book]]
Reading this book
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each chapter in this book is intended to be self contained so the reader
can jump to interesting chapters. Where there is some overlap this is
usually indicated with links to the relevant chapters.

Some parts of this book may refer to file paths or other parts of code
that can have a variable value, for example controller names contain the
module name or a file with an arbitrary name. In this case these will be
marked in the form `<TheModuleName>`, `<TheFileName>` or something else
suitable. In these cases you can substitute something appropriate (such
as `Accounts` or `MyNewFile`).

[[setting-up-suitecrm]]
Setting up SuiteCRM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this book we’ll be using SuiteCRM v7.1.5 which is the latest at time
of writing. For up to date versions of the installation instructions see
the SuiteCRM wiki at
https://suitecrm.com/wiki/index.php/Installation[suitecrm.com/wiki/index.php/Installation].

[[website]]
Website
+++++++

The SuiteCRM installer can be found at
https://suitecrm.com/[SuiteCRM.com]. I would recommend SuiteCRM MAX as I
prefer to start with a full interface and customise it as needed.

[[github]]
GitHub
++++++

SuiteCRM is also available on http://github.com[GitHub] at
https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM[github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM].
Each SuiteCRM version is tagged so you can easily grab the version you
need.

[[initial-tweaks]]
Initial Tweaks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the initial install there are a few tweaks you may want to make on
an instance you are developing on. These changes should improve your
development flow and productivity as well as help identify issues if
they occur.

[[developer-mode]]
Developer Mode
++++++++++++++

SuiteCRM will cache various files that it processes, such as Smarty
templates. Developer mode will turn off some of the caching so that
changes to files will be seen immediately (though this isn’t always the
case - as is the case with
link:#chap13.xhtml#extensions-chapter[extensions]). This can be enabled
either through the config file or via the General settings page inside
admin.

[[log-level]]
Log Level
+++++++++

The default log level of SuiteCRM is `fatal`. This is a good default for
production instances but you may want to increase the log level to
`info` or `debug`. This will make the log output more verbose so, should
anything go wrong, you’ll have something to refer to. See the
link:#chap10.xhtml#logging-chapter[chapter on logging] for more
information.

[[display-errors]]
Display errors
++++++++++++++

You’ll also want to turn off display errors. Unfortunately at the moment
SuiteCRM has various notices and warnings out of the box. With
`display_errors` on this can sometimes cause AJAX pages and the link to
break.

With this being said you should be checking the PHP error logs or
selectively enabling +
`display_errors` to ensure that the code you are creating is not
creating additional notices, warnings or errors.

[[xdebug]]
XDebug
++++++

http://xdebug.org[XDebug] is a PHP extension which provides profiling
and debugging capabilities to PHP. This can massively improve developer
productivity by simplifying development and, particularly, tracking down
any issues. See the XDebug site for information on XDebug.

[[suitecrm-directory-structure]]
2. SuiteCRM Directory Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`cache`::
  Contains cache files used by SuiteCRM including compiled smarty
  templates, grouped vardefs, minified and grouped JavaScript. Some
  modules and custom modules may also store (temporary) module specific
  info here.
`custom`::
  Contains user and developer customisations to SuiteCRM. Also contains
  some SuiteCRM code to maintain compatibility with SugarCRM. However
  this is likely to change in the future.
`data`::
  Stores the classes and files used to deal with SugarBeans and their
  relationships.
`examples`::
  Contains a few basic examples of lead capture and API usage. However
  these are very outdated.
`include`::
  Contains the bulk of non module and non data SuiteCRM code.
`install`::
  Code used by the SuiteCRM installer.
`jssource`::
  The `jssource` folder contains the unminified source of some of the
  JavaScript files used within SuiteCRM.
`metadata`::
  Stores relationship metadata for the various stock SuiteCRM modules.
  This should not be confused with module metadata which contains
  information on view, dashlet and search definitions.
`mobile`::
  Stores code for the http://www.quickcrm.fr[QuickCRM] mobile app.
`ModuleInstall`::
  Code for the module installer.
`modules`::
  Contains the code for any stock or custom SuiteCRM modules.
`service`::
  Code for the SuiteCRM Soap and REST APIs.
`themes`::
  Code, data and images for the bundled SuiteCRM theme.
`upload`::
  The `upload` folder contains documents that have been uploaded to
  SuiteCRM. The names of the files comes from the ID of the matching
  Document Revision/Note. `upload`/`upgrades` will also contain various
  upgrade files and the packages of installed modules.
`log4php`, `soap`, `XTemplate`, `Zend`::
  Source code for various libraries used by SuiteCRM some of which are
  deprecated.

[[working-with-beans]]
3. Working with Beans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beans are the Model in SuiteCRM’s MVC (Model View Controller)
architecture. They allow retrieving data from the database as objects
and allow persisting and editing records. This section will go over the
various ways of working with beans.

[[beanfactory]]
BeanFactory
^^^^^^^^^^^

The BeanFactory allows dynamically loading bean instances or creating
new records. For example to create a new bean you can use:

Example 3.1: Creating a new Bean using the BeanFactory

'''''

....
1 $bean = BeanFactory::newBean('&lt;TheModule&gt;');
2 //For example a new account bean:
3 $accountBean = BeanFactory::newBean('Accounts');
....

'''''

Retrieving an existing bean can be achieved in a similar manner:

Example 3.2: Retrieving a bean with the BeanFactory

'''''

....
1 $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('&lt;TheModule&gt;', $beanId);
2 //For example to retrieve an account id
3 $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('Accounts', $beanId);
....

'''''

`getBean` will return an unpopulated bean object if `$beanId` is not
supplied or if there’s no such record. Retrieving an unpopulated bean
can be useful if you wish to use the static methods of the bean (for
example see the Searching for Beans section). To deliberately retrieve
an unpopulated bean you can omit the second argument of the `getBean`
call. I.e.

Example 3.3: Retrieving an unpopulated bean

'''''

....
1 $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('&lt;TheModule&gt;');
....

'''''

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|image:images/leanpub_warning.png[warning,title="fig:warning",width=50]
|`BeanFactory::getBean` caches ten results. This can cause odd behaviour
if you call `getBean` again and get a cached copy. Any calls that return
a cached copy will return the same instance. This means changes to one
of the beans will be reflected in all the results.
|=======================================================================

Using BeanFactory ensures that the bean is correctly set up and the
necessary files are included etc.

[[sugarbean]]
SugarBean
^^^^^^^^^

The SugarBean is the parent bean class and all beans in SuiteCRM extend
this class. It provides various ways of retrieving and interacting with
records.

[[searching-for-beans]]
Searching for beans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following examples show how to search for beans using a bean class.
The examples provided assume that an account bean is available names
$accountBean. This may have been retrieved using the getBean call
mentioned in the BeanFactory section e.g.

Example 3.4: Retrieving an unpopulated account bean

'''''

....
$accountBean = BeanFactory::getBean('Accounts');
....

'''''

[[get_list]]
get_list
++++++++

The get_list method allows getting a list of matching beans and allows
paginating the results.

Example 3.5: get_list method signature

'''''

....
1 get_list(
2     $order_by = &quot;&quot;,
3     $where = &quot;&quot;,
4     $row_offset = 0,
5     $limit=-1,
6     $max=-1,
7     $show_deleted = 0)
....

'''''

$order_by::
  Controls the ordering of the returned list. `$order_by` is specified
  as a string that will be used in the SQL ORDER BY clause e.g. to sort
  by name you can simply pass `name`, to sort by date_entered descending
  use `date_entered DESC`. You can also sort by multiple fields. For
  example sorting by date_modified and id descending
  `date_modified, id DESC`.
$where::
  Allows filtering the results using an SQL WHERE clause. `$where`
  should be a string containing the SQL conditions. For example in the
  contacts module searching for contacts with specific first names we
  might use `contacts.first_name='Jim'`. Note that we specify the table,
  the query may end up joining onto other tables so we want to ensure
  that there is no ambiguity in which field we target.
$row_offset::
  The row to start from. Can be used to paginate the results.
$limit::
  The maximum number of records to be returned by the query. -1 means no
  limit.
$max::
  The maximum number of entries to be returned per page. -1 means the
  default max (usually 20).
$show_deleted::
  Whether to include deleted results.

[[results]]
Results

get_list will return an array. This will contain the paging information
and will also contain the list of beans. This array will contain the
following keys:

list::
  An array of the beans returned by the list query
row_count::
  The total number of rows in the result
next_offset::
  The offset to be used for the next page or -1 if there are no further
  pages.
previous_offset::
  The offset to be used for the previous page or -1 if this is the first
  page.
current_offset::
  The offset used for the current results.

[[example]]
Example

Let’s look at a concrete example. We will return the third page of all
accounts with the industry `Media` using 10 as a page size and ordered
by name.

Example 3.6: Example get_list call

'''''

....
 1 $beanList = $accountBean-&gt;get_list(
 2                                 //Order by the accounts name
 3                                 'name',
 4                                 //Only accounts with industry 'Media'
 5                                 &quot;accounts.industry = 'Media'&quot;,
 6                                 //Start with the 30th record (third page)
 7                                 30,
 8                                 //No limit - will default to max page size
 9                                 -1,
10                                 //10 items per page
11                                 10);
....

'''''

This will return:

Example 3.7: Example get_list results

'''''

....
 1 Array
 2 (
 3     //Snipped for brevity - the list of Account SugarBeans
 4     [list] =&gt; Array()
 5     //The total number of results
 6     [row_count] =&gt; 36
 7     //This is the last page so the next offset is -1
 8     [next_offset] =&gt; -1
 9     //Previous page offset
10     [previous_offset] =&gt; 20
11     //The offset used for these results
12     [current_offset] =&gt; 30
13 )
....

'''''

[[get_full_list]]
get_full_list
+++++++++++++

`get_list` is useful when you need paginated results. However if you are
just interested in getting a list of all matching beans you can use
`get_full_list`. The `get_full_list` method signature looks like this:

Example 3.8: get_full_list method signature

'''''

....
1 get_full_list(
2             $order_by = &quot;&quot;,
3             $where = &quot;&quot;,
4             $check_dates=false,
5             $show_deleted = 0
....

'''''

These arguments are identical to their usage in `get_list` the only
difference is the `$check_dates` argument. This is used to indicate
whether the date fields should be converted to their display values
(i.e. converted to the users date format).

[[results-1]]
Results

The get_full_list call simply returns an array of the matching beans

[[example-1]]
Example

Let’s rework our `get_list` example to get the full list of matching
accounts:

Example 3.9: Example get_full_list call

'''''

....
1 $beanList = $accountBean-&gt;get_full_list(
2                                 //Order by the accounts name
3                                 'name',
4                                 //Only accounts with industry 'Media'
5                                 &quot;accounts.industry = 'Media'&quot;
6                                 );
....

'''''

[[retrieve_by_string_fields]]
retrieve_by_string_fields
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sometimes you only want to retrieve one row but may not have the id of
the record. `retrieve_by_string_fields` allows retrieving a single
record based on matching string fields.

Example 3.10: retrieve_by_string_fields method signature

'''''

....
1 retrieve_by_string_fields(
2                           $fields_array,
3                           $encode=true,
4                           $deleted=true)
....

'''''

$fields_array::
  An array of field names to the desired value.
$encode::
  Whether or not the results should be HTML encoded.
$deleted::
  Whether or not to add the deleted filter.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|image:images/leanpub_warning.png[warning,title="fig:warning",width=50]
|Note here that, confusingly, the deleted flag works differently to the
other methods we have looked at. It flags whether or not we should
filter out deleted results. So if true is passed then the deleted
results will _not_ be included.
|=======================================================================

[[results-2]]
Results

retrieve_by_string_fields returns a single bean as it’s result or null
if there was no matching bean.

[[example-2]]
Example

For example to retrieve the account with name `Tortoise Corp` and
account_type `Customer` we could use the following:

Example 3.11: Example retrieve_by_string_fields call

'''''

....
1 $beanList = $accountBean-&gt;retrieve_by_string_fields(
2                                 array(
3                                   'name' =&gt; 'Tortoise Corp',
4                                   'account_type' =&gt; 'Customer'
5                                 )
6                               );
....

'''''

[[accessing-fields]]
Accessing fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have used one of the above methods we now have a bean record.
This bean represents the record that we have retrieved. We can access
the fields of that record by simply accessing properties on the bean
just like any other PHP object. Similarly we can use property access to
set the values of beans. Some examples are as follows:

Example 3.12: Accessing fields examples

'''''

....
 1 //Get the Name field on account bean
 2 $accountBean-&gt;name;
 3 
 4 //Get the Meeting start date
 5 $meetingBean-&gt;date_start;
 6 
 7 //Get a custom field on a case
 8 $caseBean-&gt;third_party_code_c;
 9 
10 //Set the name of a case
11 $caseBean-&gt;name = 'New Case name';
12 
13 //Set the billing address post code of an account
14 $accountBean-&gt;billing_address_postalcode = '12345';
....

'''''

When changes are made to a bean instance they are not immediately
persisted. We can save the changes to the database with a call to the
beans `save` method. Likewise a call to `save` on a brand new bean will
add that record to the database:

Example 3.13: Persisting bean changes

'''''

....
 1 //Get the Name field on account bean
 2 $accountBean-&gt;name = 'New account name';
 3 //Set the billing address post code of an account
 4 $accountBean-&gt;billing_address_postalcode = '12345';

|=======================================================================
|image:images/leanpub_info-circle.png[information,title="fig:information",width=50]
|Whether to save or update a bean is decided by checking the `id` field
of the bean. If `id` is set then SuiteCRM will attempt to perform an
update. If there is no `id` then one will be generated and a new record
will be inserted into the database. If for some reason you have supplied
an `id` but the record is new (perhaps in a custom import script) then
you can set `new_with_id` to true on the bean to let SuiteCRM know that
this record is new.
|=======================================================================

[[related-beans]]
Related beans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have seen how to save single records but, in a CRM system,
relationships between records are as important as the records
themselves. For example an account may have a list of cases associated
with it, a contact will have an account that it falls under etc. We can
get and set relationships between beans using several methods.

[[get_linked_beans]]
get_linked_beans
++++++++++++++++

The `get_linked_beans` method allows retrieving a list of related beans
for a given record.

Example 3.14: get_linked_beans method signature

'''''

....
1 get_linked_beans(
2                 $field_name,
3                 $bean_name,
4                 $sort_array = array(),
5                 $begin_index = 0,
6                 $end_index = -1,
7                 $deleted=0,
8                 $optional_where=&quot;&quot;);
....

'''''

$field_name::
  The link field name for this link. Note that this is not the same as
  the name of the relationship. If you are unsure of what this should be
  you can take a look into the cached vardefs of a module in
  `cache/modules/<TheModule>/<TheModule>Vardefs.php` for the link
  definition.
$bean_name::
  The name of the bean that we wish to retrieve.
$sort_array::
  This is a legacy parameter and is unused.
$begin_index::
  Skips the initial `$begin_index` results. Can be used to paginate.
$end_index::
  Return up to the `$end_index` result. Can be used to paginate.
$deleted::
  Controls whether deleted or non deleted records are shown. If true
  only deleted records will be returned. If false only non deleted
  records will be returned.
$optional_where::
  Allows filtering the results using an SQL WHERE clause. See the
  `get_list` method for more details.

[[results-3]]
Results

`get_linked_beans` returns an array of the linked beans.

[[example-3]]
Example

Example 3.15: Example get_linked_beans call

'''''

....
1 $accountBean-&gt;get_linked_beans(
2                 'contacts',
3                 'Contacts',
4                 array(),
5                 0,
6                 10,
7                 0,
8                 &quot;contacts.primary_address_country = 'USA'&quot;);
....

'''''

[[relationships]]
relationships
+++++++++++++

In addition to the `get_linked_beans` call you can also load and access
the relationships more directly.

[[loading]]
Loading

Before accessing a relationship you must use the `load_relationship`
call to ensure it is available. This call takes the link name of the
relationship (not the name of the relationship). As mentioned previously
you can find the name of the link in
`cache/modules/<TheModule>/<TheModule>Vardefs.php` if you’re not sure.

Example 3.16: Loading a relationship

'''''

....
1 //Load the relationship
2 $accountBean-&gt;load_relationship('contacts');
3 //Can now call methods on the relationship object:
4 $contactIds = $accountBean-&gt;contacts-&gt;get();
....

'''''

[[methods]]
Methods

[[get]]
`get`

Returns the ids of the related records in this relationship e.g for the
account - contacts relationship in the example above it will return the
list of ids for contacts associated with the account.

[[getbeans]]
`getBeans`

Similar to `get` but returns an array of beans instead of just ids.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|image:images/leanpub_warning.png[warning,title="fig:warning",width=50]
|`getBeans` will load the full bean for each related record. This may
cause poor performance for relationships with a large number of beans.
|=======================================================================

[[add]]
`add`

Allows relating records to the current bean. `add` takes a single id or
bean or an array of ids or beans. If the bean is available this should
be used since it prevents reloading the bean. For example to add a
contact to the relationship in our example we can do the following:

Example 3.18: Adding a new contact to a relationship

'''''

....
 1 //Load the relationship
 2 $accountBean-&gt;load_relationship('contacts');
 3 
 4 //Create a new demo contact
 5 $contactBean = BeanFactory::newBean();
 6 $contactBean-&gt;first_name = 'Jim';
 7 $contactBean-&gt;last_name = 'Mackin';
 8 $contactBean-&gt;save();
 9 
10 //Link the bean to $accountBean
11 $accountBean-&gt;contacts-&gt;add($contactBean);
....

'''''

[[delete]]
`delete`

`delete` allows unrelating beans. Counter-intuitively it accepts the ids
of both the bean and the related bean. For the related bean you should
pass the bean if it is available e.g when unrelating an account and
contact:

Example 3.19: Removing a new contact from a relationship

'''''

....
1 //Load the relationship
2 $accountBean-&gt;load_relationship('contacts');
3 
4 //Unlink the contact from the account - assumes $contactBean is a Contact SugarB\
5 ean
6 $accountBean-&gt;contacts-&gt;delete($accountBean-&gt;id, $contactBean);
....

'''''

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|image:images/leanpub_warning.png[warning,title="fig:warning",width=50]
|Be careful with the delete method. Omitting the second argument will
cause all relationships for this link to be removed.
|=======================================================================

[[vardefs]]
4. Vardefs
~~~~~~~~~~

[[what-are-vardefs]]
What are Vardefs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Vardefs are used to supply information to SuiteCRM about a
particular bean. These generally specify the fields, relationships and
indexes in a given module as well as additional information such as
whether it is audited, the table name etc.

[[defining-vardefs]]
Defining Vardefs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[module]]
Module
++++++

Vardefs are initially defined in their respective modules folder. For
the Accounts module this will be in modules/Accounts/vardefs.php. The
information is stored in an array named $dictionary using the module
name as the key. For Accounts this will be `$dictionary['Account']`.
Let’s look at the Account vardefs (which have been edited for brevity):

Example 4.1: Account Vardefs

'''''

....
 1 $dictionary['Account'] =
 2 array(
 3  'table' =&gt; 'accounts',
 4  'audited'=&gt;true,
 5  'unified_search' =&gt; true,
 6  'unified_search_default_enabled' =&gt; true,
 7  'duplicate_merge'=&gt;true,
 8  'comment' =&gt; 'Accounts are organizations or entities that ...',
 9  'fields' =&gt; array (
10    //Snipped for brevity. See the fields section.
11  ),
12  'indices' =&gt; array (
13    //Snipped for brevity. See the indices section.
14  ),
15  'relationships' =&gt; array (
16    //Snipped for brevity. See the relationship section.
17  ),
18  //This enables optimistic locking for Saves From EditView
19  'optimistic_locking'=&gt;true,
20 );
21 
22 VardefManager::createVardef(
23  'Accounts',
24  'Account',
25  array('default', 'assignable','company',)
26 );
....

'''''

[[keys]]
Keys

The following are some of the keys that can be specified for the
vardefs. Fields, indices and relationships are covered in their own
sections.

`table`::
  The database table name for this module.
`audited`::
  Whether or not this module should be audited. Note that `audited` must
  also be set at the fields level for a field to be audited.
`unified_search`::
  Whether this module can be searchable via the global search.
`unified_search_default_enabled`::
  Whether this module is searchable via the global search by default.
`duplicate_merge`::
  Whether or not duplicate merging functionality is enabled for this
  module.
`comment`::
  A description of this module.
`optimistic_locking`::
  Whether optimistic should be enabled for this module. Optimistic
  locking locks concurrent edits on a record by assuming that there will
  be no conflict. On save the last modified timestamp on the record will
  be checked. If it is different then an edit has occurred since this
  record was loaded. If this is the case then the user will be prompted
  with a page showing the differences in the two edits and asked to
  choose which edits are to be used.

[[fields]]
Fields

The field defines the behaviour and attributes of each field in the
module.

`name`::
  The name of the field.
`vname`::
  The name of the language label to be used for this field.
`type`::
  The type of the field. See the field types section.
`isnull`::
  Whether null values are allowed
`len`::
  If the field is a string type, the max number of characters allowed.
`options`::
  For enum fields the language label for the dropdown values for this
  field
`dbtype`::
  The type to be used by the database to store this field. This is not
  required as the appropriate type is usually chosen.
`default`::
  The default value of this field.
`massupdate`::
  Whether or not this field should be mass updatable. Note that some
  field types are always restricted from mass updates.
`rname`::
  For related fields only. The name of the field to be taken from the
  related module.
`id_name`::
  For related fields only. The field in this bean which contains the
  related id.
`source`::
  The source of this field. Can be set to ‘non-db’ if the field is not
  stored in the database - for example for link fields, fields populated
  by logic hooks or by other means.
`sort_on`::
  For concatenated fields (i.e. name fields) the field which should be
  used to sort.
`fields`::
  For concatenated fields (i.e. name fields) an array of the fields
  which should be concatenated.
`db_concat_fields`::
  For concatenated fields (i.e. name fields) an array of the fields
  which should be concatenated in the database. Usually this is the same
  as fields.
`unified_search`::
  True if this field should be searchable via the global search.
`enable_range_search`::
  Whether the list view search should allow a range search of this
  field. This is used for date and numeric fields.
`studio`::
  Whether the field should display in studio.
`audited`::
  Whether or not changes to this field should be audited.

[[field-types]]
Field types

The following are common field types used:

`id`::
  An id field.
`name`::
  A name field. This is usually a concatenation of other fields.
`bool`::
  A boolean field.
`varchar`::
  A variable length string field.
`char`::
  A character field.
`text`::
  A text area field.
`decimal`::
  A decimal field.
`date`::
  A date field.
`datetime`::
  A date and time field.
`enum`::
  A dropdown field.
`phone`::
  A phone number field.
`link`::
  A link to another module via a relationship.
`relate`::
  A related bean field.

[[indices]]
Indices

The indices array allows defining any database indexes that should be in
place on the database table for this module. Let’s look at an example:

Example 4.2: Example indices definition

'''''

....
 1 'indices' =&gt; array (
 2  array(
 3      'name' =&gt;'idx_mymod_id_del',
 4      'type' =&gt;'index',
 5      'fields'=&gt;array('id', 'deleted')),
 6  array(
 7      'name' =&gt;'idx_mymod_parent_id',
 8      'type' =&gt;'index',
 9      'fields'=&gt;array( 'parent_id')),
10  array(
11      'name' =&gt;'idx_mymod_parent_id',
12      'type' =&gt;'unique',
13      'fields'=&gt;array( 'third_party_id')),
14  ),
....

'''''

Each array entry should have, at least, the following entries:

name::
  The name of the index. This is usually used by the database to
  reference the index. Most databases require that these are unique.
type::
  The type of the index to create. `index` will simply add an index on
  the fields, `unique` will add a unique constraint on the fields,
  `primary` will add the fields as a primary key.
fields::
  An array of the fields to be indexed. The order of this array will be
  used as the order of the fields in the index.

[[relationships-1]]
Relationships

The Vardefs also specify the relationships within this module. Here’s an
edited example from the Accounts module:

Example 4.3: Example relationships definition

'''''

....
 1 'relationships' =&gt; array (
 2  'account_cases' =&gt; array(
 3      'lhs_module'=&gt; 'Accounts',
 4      'lhs_table'=&gt; 'accounts',
 5      'lhs_key' =&gt; 'id',
 6      'rhs_module'=&gt; 'Cases',
 7      'rhs_table'=&gt; 'cases',
 8      'rhs_key' =&gt; 'account_id',
 9      'relationship_type' =&gt; 'one-to-many'),
10 ),
....

'''''

Here we see the link between accounts and cases. This is specified with
the following keys:

`lhs_module`::
  The module on the left hand side of this relationship. For a one to
  many relationship this will be the “One” side.
`lhs_table`::
  The table for the left hand side module. If you are unsure the table
  for a module can be found in it’s vardefs.
`lhs_key`::
  The field to use for the left hand side of this link. In this case it
  is the `id` of the account.
`rhs_module`::
  The right hand side module. In this case the “many” side of the
  relationship.
`rhs_table`::
  The table for the right hand side module. As stated previously you can
  find the table for a module can be found in it’s vardefs.
`rhs_key`::
  The field to use on the right hand side. In this case the `account_id`
  field on cases.
`relationship_type`::
  The type of relationship - “one-to-many” or “many-to-many”. Since this
  is a one to many relationship it means a case is related to a single
  account but a single account can have multiple cases.

For many to many relationship fields the following keys are also
available:

`join_table`::
  The name of the join table for this relationship.
`join_key_lhs`::
  The name of the field on the join table for the left hand side.
`join_key_rhs`::
  The name of the field on the join table for the right hand side.

[[vardef-templates]]
Vardef templates
++++++++++++++++

Vardef templates provide a shortcut for defining common vardefs. This is
done by calling `VardefManager::createVardef` and passing the module
name, object name and an array of templates to be assigned. The
following is an example from the accounts vardefs:

Example 4.4: Example vardef template

'''''

....
22 VardefManager::createVardef(
23      'Accounts',
24      'Account',
25      array('default', 'assignable','company',)
26      );
....

'''''

In this example the `default`, `assignable` and `company` templates are
used. The following are some of the available templates:

`basic` +
::

`default`

::
  Adds the common base fields such as `id`, `name`, `date_entered`, etc.
`assignable`::
  Adds the fields and relationships necessary to assign a record to a
  user.
`person`::
  Adds fields common to people records such as `first_name`,
  `last_name`, address, etc.
`company`::
  Adds fields common to companies such as an industry dropdown, address,
  etc.

[[customising-vardefs]]
Customising vardefs
+++++++++++++++++++

Vardefs can be customised by adding a file into

Example 4.5: Custom vardef location

'''''

....
custom/Extension/modules/&lt;TheModule&gt;/Ext/SomeFile.php
....

'''''

This file can then be used to add a new field definition or customise an
existing one e.g changing a field type:

Example 4.6: Example overriding an existing vardef

'''''

....
$dictionary[&quot;TheModule&quot;][&quot;fields&quot;][&quot;some_field&quot;]['type'] = 'int';
....

'''''

[[views]]
5. Views
~~~~~~~~

SuiteCRM follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and as such has
the concept of views. Views are responsible for gathering and displaying
data . There are a number of default views in SuiteCRM. These include

ListView::
  Displays a list of records and provides links to the EditViews and
  DetailViews of those records. The ListView also allows some operations
  such as deleting and mass updating records. This is (usually) the
  default view for a module.
DetailView::
  Displays the details of a single record and also displays subpanels of
  related records.
EditView::
  The EditView allows editing the various fields of a record and
  provides validation on these values.

[[location]]
Location
^^^^^^^^

Views can be found in `modules/<TheModule>/views/` or, for custom
views, +
`custom/modules/<TheModule>/views/`, and are named in the following
format: `view.<viewname>.php`. For example, the Accounts DetailView can
be found in `modules/Accounts/views/view.detail.php` with a customised
version in `custom/modules/Accounts/views/view.detail.php`. The custom
version is used if it exists. If it doesn’t then the module version is
used. Finally, if neither of these exist then the SuiteCRM default is
used in `include/MVC/View/views/`.

[[customising]]
Customising
^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to customise a View we first need to create the appropriate
view file. This will vary depending on the module we wish to target.

[[custom-module]]
Custom module
+++++++++++++

In this case we can place the file directly into our module. Create a
new file (if it doesn’t exist) at
`modules/<TheModule>/views/view.<viewname>.php`. The contents will look
similar to:

Example 5.1: View for a custom module

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 
3 require_once 'include/MVC/View/views/view.&lt;viewname&gt;.php';
4 
5 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
6 class &lt;TheModule&gt;View&lt;ViewName&gt; extends View&lt;ViewName&gt;
7 {
8 
9 }
....

'''''

A more concrete example would be for the detail view for a custom module
called ABC_Vehicles:

Example 5.2: Detail view for a custom module, ABC_Vehicles

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 
3 require_once 'include/MVC/View/views/view.detail.php';
4 
5 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
6 class ABC_VehiclesViewDetail extends ViewDetail
7 {
8 
9 }
....

'''''

[[preexisting-modules]]
Preexisting modules
+++++++++++++++++++

For preexisting modules you will want to add the view to +
`custom/modules/<TheModule>/views/view.<viewname>.php`.

The contents of this file will vary depending on whether you wish to
extend the existing view (if it exists) or create your own version
completely. It is usually best to extend the existing view, since this
will retain important logic. Note the naming convention here. We name
the class +
`Custom<TheModule>View<ViewName>` (for example
`CustomAccountsViewDetail`).

Here we don’t extend the existing view or no such view exists:

Example 5.3: Custom view for an existing module

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 
4 require_once 'include/MVC/View/views/view.&lt;viewname&gt;.php';
5 
6 class Custom&lt;TheModule&gt;View&lt;ViewName&gt; extends ViewDetail
7 {
8 
9 }
....

'''''

Otherwise we extend the existing view. Note that we are requiring the
existing view:

Example 5.4: Overriding a view for an existing module

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 
4 require_once 'modules/&lt;TheModule&gt;/views/view.&lt;viewname&gt;.php';
5 
6 class Custom&lt;TheModule&gt;View&lt;ViewName&gt; extends &lt;TheModule&gt;View&lt;ViewName&gt;
7 {
8 
9 }
....

'''''

For example, overriding the List View of Accounts:

Example 5.5: Overriding the Accounts List View

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 
4 require_once 'modules/Accounts/views/view.list.php';
5 
6 class CustomAccountsViewList extends AccountsViewList
7 {
8 
9 }
....

'''''

[[making-changes]]
Making changes
++++++++++++++

Now that we have a custom view what can we actually do? The views have
various methods which we can now override to change/add behaviour. The
most common ones to override are:

preDisplay::
  Explicitly intended to allow logic to be called before display() is
  called. This can be used to alter arguments to the list view or to
  output anything to appear before the main display code (such as, for
  example, adding JavaScript).
display::
  Does the actual work of displaying the view. Can be overridden to
  alter this behaviour or to output anything after the main display. You
  usually want to call parent::display(); to ensure that the display
  code is run (unless, of course, you are adding your own display
  logic).

[[metadata]]
6. Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~

[[intro]]
Intro
^^^^^

Module metadata are used to describe how various views behave in the
module. The main use of this is providing field and layout information
but this can also be used to filter subpanels and to describe what
fields are used in the search.

[[location-1]]
Location
^^^^^^^^

Module metadata can be found in:

Example 6.1: Module metadata location

'''''

....
modules/&lt;TheModule&gt;/metadata/
....

'''''

[[customising-1]]
Customising
^^^^^^^^^^^

Usually studio is the best way of customising metadata. Even when you do
wish to make customisations that are not possible through studio it can
be simpler to set everything up in studio first. This is particularly
true for layout based metadata. However if you are customising metadata
it is as simple as placing, or editing, the file in the custom
directory. For example to override the Accounts detailviewdefs (found in
`modules/Accounts/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`) we would place (or edit)
the file in `custom/modules/Accounts/metadata/detailviewdefs.php`. One
exception to this rule is the studio.php file. The modules metadata
folder is the only location checked - any version in
`custom/<TheModule>/metadata/studio.php` is ignored.

[[different-metadata]]
Different metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[detailviewdefs.php]]
detailviewdefs.php
++++++++++++++++++

detailviewdefs.php provides information on the layout and fields of the
detail view for this module. This file uses the same structure as
editviewdefs.php. Let’s look at an example for a fictional module
`ABC_Vehicles`:

Example 6.2: DetailView metadata definition

'''''

....
 1 &lt;?php
 2 $viewdefs ['ABC_Vehicles'] ['DetailView'] = array (

We see that line 2 defines an array
`$viewdefs['ABC_Vehicles']['DetailView']` which places a DetailView
entry for the module ABC_Vehicles into `$viewdefs` (DetailView will be
EditView or QuickCreateView as appropriate). This array has two main
keys defined here:

[[templatemeta]]
templateMeta

The templateMeta key provides information about the view in general. The
`['form']['buttons']` entries define the buttons that should appear in
this view.

`maxColumns`::
  Defines the number of columns to use for this view. It is unusual for
  this to be more than 2.
`widths`::
  An array defining the width of the label and field for each column.
`includes`::
  An array of additional JavaScript files to include. This is useful for
  adding custom JavaScript behaviour to the page.

[[panels]]
panels

The panels entry defines the actual layout of the Detail (or Edit) view.
Each entry is a new panel in the view with the key being the label for
that panel. We can see in our example that we have 2 panels. One uses
the label defined by the language string `LBL_ABC_VEHICLES_INFO`, the
other uses `LBL_PANEL_ADVANCED`.

Each panel has an array entry for each row, with each array containing
an entry for each column. For example we can see that the first row has
the following definition:

Example 6.3: DetailView metadata row definition

'''''

....
31 array(
32  array (
33      'name' =&gt; 'name',
34      'comment' =&gt; 'The Name of the Vehicle',
35      'label' =&gt; 'LBL_NAME',
36  ),
37  'reg_number',
38 ),
....

'''''

This has an array definition for the first row, first column and a
string definition for the first row, second column. The string
definition is very straightforward and simply displays the detail (or
edit, as appropriate) view for that field. It will use the default
label, type, etc. In our example we are displaying the field named
`reg_number`.

The array definition for the first row, first column is a little more
complex. Each array definition must have a `name` value. In our example
we are displaying the `name` field. However we also supply some other
values. Values most commonly used are:

`comment`::
  Used to note the purpose of the field.
`label`::
  The language key for this label. If the language key is not recognised
  then this value will be used instead (see the
  link:#chap08.xhtml#language-chapter[chapter on language]).
`displayParams`::
  An array used to pass extra arguments for the field display. For the
  options and how they are used you can have a look into the appropriate
  field type in `include/SugarFields/Fields` or
  `custom/include/SugarFields/Fields`. An example is setting the size of
  a textarea:

Example 6.4: DetailView metadata displayParams

'''''

....
1 'displayParams' =&gt; array(
2     'rows' =&gt; 2,
3     'cols' =&gt; 30,
4 ),
....

'''''

customCode::
  Allows supplying custom smarty code to be used for the display. The
  code here can include any valid smarty code and this will also have
  access to the current fields in this view via `$fields`. An example of
  outputing the ID field would be `{$fields.id.value}`. Additionally the
  module labels and app labels can be accessed via `$MOD` and `$APP`
  respectively. Finally you can use `@@FIELD@@` to output the value of
  the field that would have been used. For example
  `{if $someCondition}@@FIELD@@{/if}` will conditionally show the field.

[[editviewdefs.php]]
editviewdefs.php
++++++++++++++++

`editviewdefs.php` provides information on the layout and fields of the
edit view for this module. This file uses the same structure as
detailviewdefs.php. Please see the information on detailviewdefs.php.

[[listviewdefs.php]]
listviewdefs.php
++++++++++++++++

The `listviewdefs.php` file for a module defines what fields the list
view for that module will display. Let’s take a look at an example:

Example 6.5: ListView metadata definition

'''''

....
 1 $listViewDefs ['AOR_Reports'] =
 2 array (
 3   'NAME' =&gt;
 4   array (
 5     'width' =&gt; '15%',

21     'label' =&gt; 'LBL_ASSIGNED_TO_NAME',
22     'module' =&gt; 'Employees',
23     'id' =&gt; 'ASSIGNED_USER_ID',
24     'default' =&gt; true,
25   ),
26   'DATE_ENTERED' =&gt;
27   array (
28     'type' =&gt; 'datetime',
29     'label' =&gt; 'LBL_DATE_ENTERED',
30     'width' =&gt; '15%',

37     'width' =&gt; '15%',
38     'default' =&gt; true,
39   ),
40 );
....

'''''

To define the list view defs we simply add a key to the `$listViewDefs`
array. In this case we add an entry for `AOR_Reports` This array
contains an entry for each field that we wish to show in the list view
and is keyed by the upper case name of the field. For example, the
`REPORT_MODULE` key refers to the `report_module` field of AOR_Reports.

type::
  The type of the field. This can be used to override how a field is
  displayed.
default::
  Whether this field should be shown in the list view by default. If
  false then the field will appear in the available columns list in
  studio.
studio::
  Whether or not this field should be displayed in studio. This can be
  useful to ensure that a critical field is not removed.
label::
  The label to be used for this field. If this is not supplied then the
  default label for that field will be used.
width::
  The width of the field in the list view. Note that, although this is
  usually given as a percentage it is treated as a proportion. The
  example above has five columns with a width of `15%` but these will
  actually be `20%` since this is a ratio.

[[popupdefs.php]]
popupdefs.php

popupdefs.php provides information on the layout, fields and search
options of the module popup that is usually used when selecting a
related record.

The popupdefs.php specifies a `$popupMeta` array with the following
keys:

`moduleMain`::
  The module that will be displayed by this popup.
`varName`::
  The variable name used to store the search preferences etc. This will
  usually simply the upper case module name.
`className`::
  The class name of the SugarBean for this module. If this is not
  supplied then `moduleMain` will be used. This is only really required
  for classes where the class name and module name differ (such as
  Cases).
`orderBy`::
  The default field the list of records will be sorted by.
`whereClauses`::
  Legacy option. This is only used as a fallback when there are no
  searchdefs. Defines the names of fields to allow searching for and
  their database representation.
`listviewdefs`::
  The list of fields displayed in the popup list view. See
  `listviewdefs.php`.
`searchdefs`::
  An array of the fields that should be available for searching in the
  popup. See the individual search defs in the searchdefs.php section
  (for example the `basic_search` array).

[[quickcreatedefs.php]]
quickcreatedefs.php

Here we setup a new array for `Accounts` in the `$searchdefs` array.
This has two keys:

[[templatemeta-1]]
templateMeta

The `templateMeta` key controls the basic look of the search forms. Here
we define some overall layout info such as the maximum columns (3) and
the maximum number of columns for the basic search (4). Finally we set
the widths for the search fields and their labels.

[[layout]]
layout

The `layout` key contains the layout definitions for the basic search
and advanced search. This is simply a list of array definition of the
fields. See the section on listviewdefs.php for a description of some of
the options.

[[subpaneldefs.php]]
`subpaneldefs.php`

The subpaneldefs.php file provides definitions for the subpanels that
appear in the detail view of a module. Let’s look at an example:

Example 6.8: Subpanel metadata definition

'''''

....
 1 $layout_defs['AOS_Quotes'] = array (

60  )
61 );
....

'''''

In the example above we set up a definition for a module (in this case
`AOS_Quotes`) in the `$layout_defs` array. This has a single key
`subpanel_setup` which is an array of each of the subpanel definitions
keyed by a name. This name should be something recognisable. In the case
above it is the name of the link field displayed by the subpanel. The
entry for each subpanel usually has the following defined:

order::
  A number used for sorting the subpanels. The values themselves are
  arbitrary and are only used relative to other subpanels.
module::
  The module which will be displayed by this subpanel. For example the
  `aos_quotes_project` def in the example above will display a list of
  `Project` records.
subpanel_name::
  The subpanel from the displayed module which will be used. See the
  subpanels section of this chapter.
sort_by::
  The field to sort the records on.
sort_order::
  The order in which to sort the `sort_by` field. `asc` for ascending
  `desc` for descending.
title_key::
  The language key to be used for the label of this subpanel.
get_subpanel_data::
  Used to specify where to retrieve the subpanel records. Usually this
  is just a link name for the current module. In this case the related
  records will be displayed in the subpanel. However, for more complex
  links, it is possible to specify a function to call. When specifying a
  function you should ensure that the `get_subpanel_data` entry is in
  the form `function:theFunctionName`. Additionally you can specify the
  location of the function and any additional parameters that are needed
  by using the `function_parameters` key. An example of a subpanel which
  uses a function can be found in link:#chap19.xhtml#appendix-a[Appendix
  A].
function_parameters::
  Specifies the parameters for a subpanel which gets it’s information
  from a function (see +

`get_subpanel_data`). This is an array which allows specifying where the
function is by using the `import_function_file` key (if this is absent
but `get_subpanel_data` defines a function then the function will be
called on the bean for the parent of the subpanel). Additionally this
array will be passed as an argument to the function defined in
`get_subpanel_data` which allows passing in arguments to the function.

generate_select::
  For function subpanels (see `get_subpanel_data`) whether or not the
  function will return an array representing the query to be used (for
  `generate_select = true`) or whether it will simply return the query
  to be used as a string.
get_distinct_data::
  Whether or not to only return distinct rows. Relationships do not
  allow linking two records more than once therefore this only really
  applies if the subpanel source is a function. See +

`get_subpanel_data` for information on function subpanel sources.

top_buttons::
  Allows defining the buttons to appear on the subpanel. This is simply
  an array of the button definitions. These definitions have, at least,
  the `widget_class` defined which decides the button class to use in
  `include/generic/SugarWidgets`. Depending on the button this array may
  also be used to pass in extra arguments to the widget class.

[[subpanels]]
subpanels
+++++++++

Inside the metadata folder is the `subpanels` folder. This allows
creating different subpanel layouts for different parent modules. For
example, the Contacts module will display differently in the subpanel on
an account than it will in the subpanel of a case. The files inside the
`subpanels` folder can be named anything. All that matters is that it
can be referenced in the `subpanel_name` of the `subpaneldefs.php` of
the parent module. The usual subpanel file is simply called
`default.php`. Let’s look at the
`modules/Accounts/metadata/subpanels/default.php` file:

Example 6.8: Module Subpanels definition

'''''

....
 1 $subpanel_layout = array(
 2  'top_buttons' =&gt; array(
 3      array(
 4          'widget_class' =&gt; 'SubPanelTopCreateButton'
 5      ),
 6      array(
 7          'widget_class' =&gt; 'SubPanelTopSelectButton', 
 8          'popup_module' =&gt; 'Accounts'
 9      ),
10  ),
11  'where' =&gt; '',
12  'list_fields' =&gt; array (
13    'name' =&gt;
14    array (
15     'vname' =&gt; 'LBL_LIST_ACCOUNT_NAME',
16     'widget_class' =&gt; 'SubPanelDetailViewLink',
17     'width' =&gt; '45%',
18     'default' =&gt; true,
19    ),
20    'billing_address_city' =&gt;
21    array (
22      'vname' =&gt; 'LBL_LIST_CITY',
23      'width' =&gt; '20%',
24      'default' =&gt; true,
25    ),
26    'billing_address_country' =&gt;
27    array (
28      'type' =&gt; 'varchar',
29      'vname' =&gt; 'LBL_BILLING_ADDRESS_COUNTRY',
30      'width' =&gt; '7%',
31      'default' =&gt; true,
32    ),
33    'phone_office' =&gt;
34    array (
35      'vname' =&gt; 'LBL_LIST_PHONE',
36      'width' =&gt; '20%',
37      'default' =&gt; true,
38    ),
39    'edit_button' =&gt;
40    array (
41      'vname' =&gt; 'LBL_EDIT_BUTTON',
42      'widget_class' =&gt; 'SubPanelEditButton',
43      'width' =&gt; '4%',
44      'default' =&gt; true,
45    ),
46    'remove_button' =&gt;
47    array (
48      'vname' =&gt; 'LBL_REMOVE',
49      'widget_class' =&gt; 'SubPanelRemoveButtonAccount',
50      'width' =&gt; '4%',
51      'default' =&gt; true,
52    ),
53    )
54 );
....

'''''

There are three keys in the `$subpanel_layout` variable for this
subpanel. These are:

`top_buttons`::
  Defines the buttons that will appear at the top of the subpanel. See
  the `top_buttons` key in `subpaneldefs.php`.
`where`::
  Allows the addition of conditions to the `where` clause. For example
  this could be used to exclude Cases that are closed
  (`cases.state != "Closed"`) or only include Accounts of a specific
  industry (`accounts.industry = "Media"`). Note that in these examples
  we specify the table to remove any ambiguity in the query.
`list_fields`::
  Defines the list of fields to be displayed in this subpanel. See the
  section on `listviewdefs.php` for more information.

[[studio.php]]
studio.php
++++++++++

studio.php is the simplest file in metadata and it’s existence is simply
used to confirm if a module should be shown in studio for user tweaking.
Note that, unlike other metadata files, the file in
`modules/<TheModule>/metadata/studio.php` will be the only one checked.
A file in `custom/modules/<TheModule>/metadata/studio.php` will have no
effect.

[[controllers]]
7. Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SuiteCRM follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and as such has
the concept of controllers. The controller is responsible for making
changes to the Model as well as passing control to the view as
appropriate. SuiteCRM has the concept of actions which are actions that
will be taken by the controller. Let’s take a look at a SuiteCRM URL:

Example 7.1: Example SuiteCRM URL

'''''

....
example.com/index.php?module=Accounts&amp;action=index
....

'''''

In this (rather boring) example we see that the module is Accounts. This
will determine which controller to use and then call the index action on
that controller.

SuiteCRM will first look for the controller in
`custom/module/<TheModule>/controller.php`. If this is not found then
next `module/<TheModule>/controller.php` will be checked. Finally if
neither of these controllers exist then the default controller will be
used. The default controller can be found in
`include/MVC/Controller/SugarController.php`.

[[customising-controllers]]
Customising controllers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ordinarily the default controller handles the request and delegates to
the appropriate views etc. However custom controllers can be used to add
or alter functionality. Let’s look at adding a new action.

In the first instance we will have to add our custom controller. This
will vary slightly depending on the nature of the module.

[[custom-module-1]]
Custom module
+++++++++++++

In this case we can place the file directly into our module. You should
create a new file (if it doesn’t exist) at
`modules/<TheModule>/controller.php`. The contents will look similar to:

Example 7.2: Creating a custom controller for a custom module

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 class &lt;TheModule&gt;Controller extends SugarController
4 {
5 
6 }
....

'''''

[[pre-existing-modules]]
Pre-existing modules
++++++++++++++++++++

For pre-existing modules you should add the controller to +
`custom/modules/<TheModule>/controller.php`.

The contents of this file will vary depending on whether you wish to
extend the existing controller (if it exists) or create your own version
completely. It is usually best to extend the existing controller since
this will retain important logic. You should note the naming convention
here. We name the class +
`Custom<TheModule>Controller`.

Here we don’t extend the existing controller or no such controller
exists:

Example 7.3: Creating a custom controller for an existing module

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 class Custom&lt;TheModule&gt;Controller extends SugarController
4 {
5 
6 }
....

'''''

Alternatively we extend the existing controller. Note that we are
requiring the existing controller:

Example 7.4: Creating a custom controller for an existing module with an
existing controller

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 
4 require_once 'modules/&lt;TheModule&gt;/controller.php';
5 
6 class Custom&lt;TheModule&gt;Controller extends &lt;TheModule&gt;Controller
7 {
8 
9 }
....

'''''

[[adding-the-action]]
Adding the action
+++++++++++++++++

Now we can add a new action to our controller. Actions are created as
methods on the controller with the name `action_<actionName>`. For
example, to create a new action called ‘echo’ we could create the
following method in one of the controllers we have created above. This
can then perform whatever logic that is needed. In our example we will
log the REQUEST and simply redirect:

Example 7.5: Adding a custom controller action method

'''''

....
1 public function action_echo(){
2   $GLOBALS['log']-&gt;debug(&quot;Echo called with request: &quot;.print_r($_REQUEST,1));
3   SugarApplication::redirect('index.php');
4 }
....

'''''

[[legacy-style]]
Legacy Style
++++++++++++

In previous versions of SugarCRM a new action was added by creating a
file in either `modules/<TheModule>/<actionname>.php` or
`custom/modules/<TheModule>/<actionname>.php`. Although this still works
it is not recommended.

[[entry-points]]
8. Entry Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Entry points are simply a page which provides access to SuiteCRM. These
can be used for a variety of purposes such as allowing an external form
simple access to SuiteCRM or, as is the case with the stock Events
module, allowing an event invite to be responded to by clicking a link
in an email.

[[creating-an-entry-point]]
Creating an entry point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let’s create a simple entry point to display the time. First we define
this entry point in a new file in:

Example 8.1: Entry point registry location

'''''

....
custom/Extension/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/
....

'''''

For our example we’ll call our new file MyTimeEntryPoint.php

Example 8.2: Example entry point location

'''''

....
custom/Extension/application/Ext/EntryPointRegistry/MyTimeEntryPoint.php
....

'''''

In this file we will add a new entry to the `$entry_point_registry`. We
supply the file that should be called. Here we are simply placing the
file in custom if the entry point is related to a specific module it is
usually a good idea to place this somewhere inside
`custom/<TheModule>/`.

In addition we supply an “auth” parameter. If “auth” is true then anyone
accessing the entry point will need to be logged into SuiteCRM.

Example 8.3: Adding an entry point entry

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2   $entry_point_registry['MyTimeEntryPoint'] = array(
3       'file' =&gt; 'custom/MyTimeEntryPoint.php',
4       'auth' =&gt; true,
5   );
....

'''''

Finally we add the actual logic itself inside
custom/MyTimeEntryPoint.php:

Example 8.4: Example entry point that outputs the current time

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
3 $date = new DateTime();
4 echo $date-&gt;format('r');
....

'''''

After a Quick Repair and Rebuild we can access our entry point:

Example 8.5: Custom entry point URL

'''''

....
example.com/index.php?entryPoint=MyTimeEntryPoint
....

'''''

and we should see something similar to:

Example 8.6: MyTimeEntryPoint

'''''

....
Sun, 15 Mar 2015 13:03:03 +0000
....

'''''

Obviously this is a contrived example but any logic that can be
performed elsewhere in SuiteCRM can be performed in an entry point (for
example creating or editing
link:#chap02.xhtml#working-with-beans-chapter[SugarBeans]).

[[language-strings]]
9. Language Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Language strings provide an element of internationalisation to SuiteCRM.
It allows specifying different strings to be used in different languages
making it much easier to provide translations for modules and
customisations. Even if you are only targeting a single language it is
still worth using the language string functionality in SuiteCRM because
it allows the simple changing of strings within SuiteCRM and it also
allows users to customise the labels used in your customisations. There
are three main types of language strings that we will cover here.

At the core, the language strings are a key value store. The keys are
used throughout SuiteCRM and the values are loaded based on the current
language.

Languages are handled in SuiteCRM by prefixing the file name with the
IETF language code for the language that this file contains. Here are
some examples of different language file names:

Example 9.1: Example language file names

'''''

....
# Core Accounts language file for en_us (United States English)
modules/Accounts/language/en_us.lang.php

# Core Cases language file for es_es (Spanish as spoken in Spain)
modules/Cases/language/es_es.lang.php

# Custom language file for de_de (German)
custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/de_de.SomeCustomPackage.php
....

'''''

SuiteCRM will choose the language prefix to be used based on the
language the user selected when logging in or the default language if
none was selected. Generally when a language file is loaded the default
language files and the `en_us` files will also be loaded. These files
are then merged. This ensures that there will still be a definition if
there are language keys in either `en_us` or the default language that
don’t have definitions in the current language. In essence the language
“falls back” to the default language and `en_us` if there are missing
keys.

[[module-strings]]
Module Strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[use]]
Use
+++

Module strings are strings associated with a particular module. These
are usually, for example, field labels and panel name labels, but they
may be used for anything that is specific to a single module.

[[definition-location]]
Definition location
+++++++++++++++++++

Module strings are defined in the `$mod_strings` array. This is
initially defined in +
`modules/<TheModule>/language/<LanguageTag>.lang.php`, for example +
`modules/Accounts/language/en_us.lang.php`.

[[customisation-location]]
Customisation location
++++++++++++++++++++++

Customisations can be made to the module strings by adding a new file
in +
`custom/Extension/modules/<TheModule>/Ext/Language/<LanguageTag>.<Name>.php`
(`<Name>` in this case should be used to give it a descriptive name). An
example is
`custom/Extension/modules/Accounts/Ext/Language/en_us.MyLanguageFile.php`.
See the Extensions section for more information on the Extensions
folder.

[[application-strings]]
Application Strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[use-1]]
Use
+++

Application strings are used for language strings and labels that are
not specific to a single module. Examples of these may include labels
that will appear in the headers or footers, labels that appear on search
buttons throughout SuiteCRM or labels for pagination controls.

[[definition-location-1]]
Definition location
+++++++++++++++++++

The application strings are defined in the `$app_strings` array. This is
initially defined in +
`include/language/<LanguageTag>.lang.php`.

[[customisation-location-1]]
Customisation location
++++++++++++++++++++++

Customisations can be made to the application strings in two ways.
Firstly you can edit the file +
`custom/include/language/<LanguageTag>.lang.php`. However to promote
modularity it is recommended that you add a new file in the location +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/<LanguageTag>.<Name>.php`.
For example +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/es_es.MyAppLanguageFile.php`.
`<Name>` should be used to give the file a descriptive name. See the
Extensions section for more information on the Extensions folder.

[[application-list-strings]]
Application List Strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[use-2]]
Use
+++

Application list strings are used to store the various dropdowns and
lists used in SuiteCRM. Most of these are used as options for the
various enum fields in SuiteCRM e.g the account type or the opportunity
sales stage.

[[definition-location-2]]
Definition location
+++++++++++++++++++

The application list strings are defined in the `$app_list_strings`
array. Similar to the `$app_strings` array this is initially defined in
`include/language/en_us.lang.php`.

[[customisation-location-2]]
Customisation location
++++++++++++++++++++++

Customisations can be made to the application list strings in two ways.
Firstly you can edit the file +
`custom/include/language/<LanguageTag>.lang.php`. However to promote
modularity it is recommended that you add a new file in the location +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/<LanguageTag>.<Name>.php`
(`<Name>` should be used to give the file a descriptive name). For
example +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Language/es_es.MyAppListLanguageFile.php`.
See the Extensions section for more information on the Extensions
folder.

[[why-and-when-to-customise]]
Why and when to customise
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generally language strings should be changed from within SuiteCRM using
the studio tool. However there are times when it can be simpler to add
or modify language strings as described in the previous section. If you
are importing a large number of language strings or dropdown options it
can be simpler to create a new file to add these values. Similarly if
you are adding entirely new functionality, it is usually best to simply
add these language strings as new values.

[[usage]]
Usage
^^^^^

Language strings are used automatically throughout SuiteCRM. For example
in metadata you can specify the language strings to display for fields.
However in some cases you will want to access and use the language
strings in custom code. There are several ways to do this.

[[globals]]
Globals
+++++++

The `$mod_strings`, `$app_strings` and `$app_list_strings` variables are
all global and can be accessed as such. `$app_strings` and
`$app_list_strings` will always be available. However `$mod_strings`
will only contain the strings for the current module (see the next
section for other ways of accessing `$mod_strings`).

Example 9.2: Accessing language strings globally

'''''

....
 1 function someFunction(){
 2     global $mod_strings, $app_strings, $app_list_strings;
 3     /*
 4      * Grab the label LBL_NAME for the current module
 5      * In most modules this will be the label for the
 6      * name field of the module.
 7      */
 8     $modLabel = $mod_strings['LBL_NAME'];
 9 
10     $appLabel = $app_strings['LBL_GENERATE_LETTER'];
11 
12     /*
13      * Unlike the previous two examples $appListLabel will be an
14      * array of the dropdowns keys to it's display labels.
15      */
16     $appListLabel = $app_list_strings['aos_quotes_type_dom'];
17 
18     //Here we just log out the strings
19     $GLOBALS['log']-&gt;debug(&quot;The module label is $modLabel&quot;);
20     $GLOBALS['log']-&gt;debug(&quot;The app label is $appLabel&quot;);
21     $GLOBALS['log']-&gt;debug(&quot;The app list label is &quot;.print_r($appListLabel,1));
22 }
....

'''''

[[translate]]
Translate
+++++++++

As an alternative to using globals or, if you are in a different module
than the language string you wish to retrieve you can use the
`translate` method.

Example 9.3: `translate` method signature

'''''

....
1 translate(
2         $string,
3         $mod='',
4         $selectedValue='')
....

'''''

$string::
  The language string to be translated.
$mod::
  The module this string should come from. Defaults to the current
  module if empty.
$selectedValue::
  For dropdown strings. This will return the label for the key
  `$selectedValue`

Here is an example of the above in action. Note that we do not have to
worry about whether the label is a Module string, an Application string
or an Application list string, as all of these will be checked (in that
order - the first matching value will be returned).

Example 9.4: Example `translate` method calls

'''''

....
 1 function someFunction(){
 2   //Grab the label LBL_NAME for the current module
 3   $modLabel = translate('LBL_NAME');

JavaScript
++++++++++

Finally, you may be using JavaScript (for example in a view), and wish
to display a language string. For this you can use the
`SUGAR.language.get` method, which is similar to the `translate` method
in example 9.3.

Example 9.5: `SUGAR.language.get` method signature

'''''

....
1 SUGAR.language.get(
2               module,
3               str
4 );
....

'''''

module::
  The module a language string will be returned for. You should supply
  `app_strings` or +

`app_list_strings` if the label you wish to retrieve is not a module
string.

str::
  The key you want to retrieve a label for.

Example 9.6: Example `SUGAR.language.get` method calls

'''''

....
 1 function someFunction(){
 2 
 3   /*
 4    * Grab the label LBL_NAME for AOS_Products
 5    * Note that, unlike the translate function in example 9.3
 6    * the module name is required.
 7    */
 8 
 9   var modLabel = SUGAR.language.get('AOS_Products', 'LBL_NAME');
10 
11   /*
12    * As mentioned above we explicitly need to pass if we are retrieving
13    * an app_string or app_list_string
14    */
15   var appLabel = SUGAR.language.get('app_strings', 'LBL_GENERATE_LETTER');
16   var appListLabel = SUGAR.language.get('app_list_strings',
17                                         'aos_quotes_type_dom');
18 
19   //Here we just log out the strings
20   console.log(&quot;The module label is &quot;+modLabel);
21   console.log(&quot;The app label is &quot;+appLabel);
22   console.log(&quot;The app list label is &quot;+appListLabel);

[[config]]
10. Config
~~~~~~~~~~

[[the-config-files]]
The config files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two main config files in SuiteCRM, both of which are in the
root SuiteCRM folder. These are `config.php` and `config_override.php`.
The definitions in here provide various configuration options for
SuiteCRM. All the way from the details used to access the database to
how many entries to show per page in the list view. Most of these
options are accessible from the SuiteCRM administration page. However
some are only definable in the config files.

[[config.php]]
config.php
++++++++++

This is the main SuiteCRM config file and includes important information
like the database settings and the current SuiteCRM version.

Generally settings in this file wont be changed by hand. An exception to
this is if SuiteCRM has been moved or migrated. In which case you may
need to change the database settings and the site_url. Let’s look at the
database settings first:

Example 10.1: Database config definition

'''''

....
 1 'dbconfig' =&gt;
 2 array (
 3   'db_host_name' =&gt; 'localhost',
 4   'db_host_instance' =&gt; 'SQLEXPRESS',
 5   'db_user_name' =&gt; 'dbuser',
 6   'db_password' =&gt; 'dbpass',
 7   'db_name' =&gt; 'dbname',
 8   'db_type' =&gt; 'mysql',
 9   'db_port' =&gt; '',
10   'db_manager' =&gt; 'MysqliManager',
11 ),
....

'''''

Here we can see this instance is setup to access a local MySQL instance
using the username/password dbuser/dbpass and accessing the database
named ‘dbname’.

The site url settings are even simpler:

Example 10.2: Setting the site URL

'''''

....
  'site_url' =&gt; 'http://example.com/suitecrm',
....

'''''

The site url for the above is simply ‘http://example.com/suitecrm’ if we
were moving this instance to, for example, suite.example.org, then we
can simply place that value in the file.

These are generally the only two instances where you would directly
change `config.php`. For other changes you would either make the change
through SuiteCRM itself or you would use the +
`config_override.php` file.

[[config_override.php]]
config_override.php
+++++++++++++++++++

`config_override.php` allows you to make config changes without risking
breaking the main config file. This is achieved quite simply by adding,
editing or removing items from the $sugar_config variable. The
`config_override.php` file will be merged with the existing config
allowing, as the name suggests, overriding the config. For example in
config_override.php we can add our own, new, config item:

Example 10.3: Adding a custom config value

'''''

....
$sugar_config['enable_the_awesome'] = true;
....

'''''

or we can edit an existing config option in a very similar manner by
simply overwriting it:

Example 10.4: Overwriting an existing config value

'''''

....
$sugar_config['logger']['level'] = 'debug';
....

'''''

[[using-config-options]]
Using config options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We may want to access config options in custom code (or as detailed
above if we have created our own config setting we may want to use
that). We can easily get the config using the php global keyword:

Example 10.5: Accessing a config setting within SuiteCRM

'''''

....
1 function myCustomLogic(){
2   //Get access to config
3   global $sugar_config;
4   //use the config values
5   if(!empty($sugar_config['enable_the_awesome'])){
6     doTheAwesome();
7   }
8 }
....

'''''

[[logging]]
11. Logging
~~~~~~~~~~~

[[logging-messages]]
Logging messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Logging in SuiteCRM is achieved by accessing the log global. Accessing
an instance of the logger is as simple as

Example 11.1: Accessing the log

'''''

....
$GLOBALS['log']
....

'''''

This can then be used to log a message. Each log level is available as a
method. For example:

Example 11.2: Logging messages

'''''

....
1 $GLOBALS['log']-&gt;debug('This is a debug message');
2 $GLOBALS['log']-&gt;error('This is an error message');
....

'''''

This will produce the following output:

Example 11.3: Logging messages example output

'''''

....
1 Tue Apr 28 16:52:21 2015 [15006][1][DEBUG] This is a debug message
2 Tue Apr 28 16:52:21 2015 [15006][1][ERROR] This is an error message
....

'''''

[[logging-output]]
Logging output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The logging output displays the following information by default:

Example 11.4: Logging messages example output

'''''

....
&lt;Date&gt; [&lt;ProcessId&gt;][&lt;UserId&gt;][&lt;LogLevel&gt;] &lt;LogMessage&gt;
....

'''''

`<Date>`::
  The date and time that the message was logged.
`<ProcessId>`::
  The PHP process id.
`<UserId>`::
  The ID of the user that is logged into SuiteCRM.
`<LogLevel>`::
  The log level for this log message.
`<LogMessage>`::
  The contents of the log message.

[[log-levels]]
Log levels
^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the level setting in admin some messages will not be added
to the log e.g if your logger is set to `error` then you will only see
log levels of `error` or higher (`error`, `fatal` and `security`).

The default log levels (in order of verbosity) are:

* `debug`
* `info`
* `warn`
* `deprecated`
* `error`
* `fatal`
* `security`

Generally on a production instance you will use the less verbose levels
(probably `error` or `fatal`). However whilst you are developing you can
use whatever level you prefer. I prefer the most verbose level -
`debug`.

[[logic-hooks]]
12. Logic Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[intro-1]]
Intro
^^^^^

Logic hooks allow you to hook into various events in SuiteCRM to fire
custom code. This can allow you to, for example, make a call to an
external API, or to create a new record if certain events occur.

[[types]]
Types
^^^^^

Logic hooks can occur in three contexts. These contexts are Application
Hooks, Module Hooks and User Hooks. These are detailed below.

[[application-hooks]]
Application Hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Application hooks are hooks which are fired in the application context
(that is, they are not fired against a particular module). These hooks
must be defined in the top level logic hook (i.e.
`custom/modules/logic_hooks.php`).

after_entry_point::
  Called after SuiteCRM has initialised but before any other processing
  is carried out.
after_ui_footer::
  Called after the UI footer.
after_ui_frame::
  Fired after the UI has been displayed but before the footer has been
  displayed.
server_round_trip::
  Fired at the end of every page request.

[[user-hooks]]
User Hooks
^^^^^^^^^^

User hooks are fired for certain login/logout actions. Similar to
Application Hooks, these hooks must be defined in the top level logic
hook (i.e. custom/modules/logic_hooks.php).

after_login::
  Fired after a user logs in to SuiteCRM .
after_logout::
  Fired when a user logs out of SuiteCRM.
before_logout::
  Fired before a user logs out of SuiteCRM.
login_failed::
  Fired when a user attempts to login to SuiteCRM but the login fails.

[[module-hooks]]
Module Hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Module Hooks are called on various record actions for a specific module.

after_delete::
  Fired when a record is deleted.
after_relationship_add::
  Fired after a relationship is added between two records. Note that
  this may be called twice, once for each side of the relationship.
after_relationship_delete::
  Fired after a relationship between two records is deleted.
after_restore::
  Fired after a record is undeleted.
after_retrieve::
  Fired after a record is retrieved from the DB.
after_save::
  Fired after a record is saved. Note that due to some peculiarities
  some related modules may not be persisted to the database. The logic
  hook is fired within the SugarBean classes save method. Some
  implementing classes may save related beans after this method returns.
  A notable example of this is the saving of email addresses in Company
  modules.
before_delete::
  Fired before a record is deleted.
before_relationship_add::
  Fired before a relationship is added between two records. Note that
  this may be called twice, once for each side of the relationship.
before_relationship_delete::
  Fired before a relationship between two records is deleted. Note that
  this may be called twice, once for each side of the relationship.
before_restore::
  Fired before a record is undeleted.
before_save::
  Fired before a record is saved.
handle_exception::
  Fired when an exception occurs in a record.
process_record::
  Fired when a record is processed ready to be displayed in list views
  or dashlets.

[[job-queue-hooks]]
Job Queue Hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Job queue hooks are fired for scheduler jobs. Similar to application
hooks these hooks must be defined in the top level logic hook (i.e.
`custom/modules/logic_hooks.php`).

job_failure::
  Fired when a scheduled job either returns false to signify failure or
  throws an exception and it will not be retried. See the section on
  link:#chap12.xhtml#scheduled-tasks-chapter[Scheduled Tasks].
job_failure_retry::
  Fired when a scheduled job either returns false to signify failure or
  throws an exception but it will be retried. See the section on
  link:#chap12.xhtml#scheduled-tasks-chapter[Scheduled Tasks].

[[implementing]]
Implementing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the Logic Hook type logic hooks are either placed into +
`custom/modules/Logic_Hooks.php` or
`custom/modules/<TargetModule>/Logic_Hooks.php`.

[[logic_hooks.php]]
Logic_Hooks.php
+++++++++++++++

The logic hook file itself specifies which logic hooks to fire on this
event. It looks something like this:

Example 12.1: Logic hook file

'''''

....
 1 &lt;?php
 2 // Do not store anything in this file that is not part of the array or the hook
 3 //version.  This file will be automatically rebuilt in the future.

....

'''''

Let’s go through each part of the file.

....
4 $hook_version = 1;
....

This sets the hook version that we are using. Currently there is only
one version so this line is unused.

....
5 $hook_array = Array();
....

Here we set up an empty array for our Logic Hooks. This should always be
called $hook_array.

....
7 $hook_array['before_save'] = Array();
....

Here we are going to be adding some before_save hooks so we add an empty
array for that key.

....
 8 $hook_array['before_save'][] = Array(
 9                               77,
10                               'updateGeocodeInfo',
11                               'custom/modules/Cases/CasesJjwg_MapsLogicHook.php',
12                               'CasesJjwg_MapsLogicHook',
13                               'updateGeocodeInfo');
....

Finally we reach an interesting line. This adds a new logic hook to the
before_save hooks. This array contains 5 entries which define this hook.
These are:

[[sort-order]]
Sort order

The first argument (77) is the sort order for this hook. The logic hook
array is sorted by this value. If you wish for a hook to fire earlier
you should use a lower number. If you wish for a hook to be fired later
you should use a higher number. The numbers themselves are arbitrary.

[[hook-label]]
Hook label

The second argument (‘updateGeocodeInfo’) is simply a label for the
logic hook. This should be something short but descriptive.

[[hook-file]]
Hook file

The third argument is where the actual class for this hook is. In this
case it is in a file called
`custom/modules/Cases/CasesJjwg_MapsLogicHook.php`. Generally you will
want the files to be somewhere in custom and it is usual to have them in
`custom/modules/<TheModule>/<SomeDescriptiveName>.php` or
`custom/modules/<SomeDescriptiveName>.php` for Logic Hooks not targeting
a specific module. However the files can be placed anywhere.

[[hook-class]]
Hook class

The fourth argument is the class name for the Logic Hook class. In this
case +
`CasesJjwg_MapsLogicHook`. It is usual for the class name to match the
file name but this is not required.

[[hook-method]]
Hook method

The fifth, and final, argument is the method that will be called on the
class. In this case `updateGeocodeInfo`.

[[adding-your-own-logic-hooks]]
Adding your own logic hooks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When adding logic hooks you should make full use of the Extensions
framework (see the section on Extensions). This involves creating a file
in +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/LogicHooks/` for application hooks
and +
`custom/Extension/modules/<TheModule>/Ext/LogicHooks/` for module
specific hooks. These files can then add to/alter the `$hook_array` as
appropriate.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|image:images/leanpub_info-circle.png[information,title="fig:information",width=50]
|After adding a new logic hook it is necessary to perform a quick repair
and rebuild in the admin menu for this to be picked up.
|=======================================================================

[[logic-hook-function]]
Logic Hook function
+++++++++++++++++++

The logic hook function itself will vary slightly based on the logic
hook type. For module hooks it will appear similar to:

Example 12.2: Example logic hook method

'''''

....
1     class SomeClass
2     {
3         function someMethod($bean, $event, $arguments)
4         {
5           //Custom Logic
6         }
7     }
....

'''''

Application logic hooks omit the $bean argument:

Example 12.3: Example logic hook method for application hooks

'''''

....
1     class SomeClass
2     {
3         function someMethod($event, $arguments)
4         {
5           //Custom Logic
6         }
7     }
....

'''''

[[bean-sugarbean]]
$bean (`SugarBean`)

The $bean argument passed to your logic hook is usually the bean that
the logic hook is being performed on. For User Logic Hooks this will be
the current User object. For module logic hooks (such as `before_save`)
this will be the record that is being saved. For job queue logic hooks
this will be the SchedulersJob bean. Note that for Application Logic
Hook this argument is not present.

[[event-string]]
$event (`string`)

The $event argument contains the logic hook event e.g `process_record`,
`before_save`, +
`after_delete` etc.

[[arguments-array]]
$arguments (`array`)

The $arguments argument contains any additional details of the logic
hook event. I.e. in the case of before_relationship_add this will
contain details of the related modules.

hook (such as saving a bean) then you need to be aware that this will
trigger the logic hooks associated with that bean and action. This can
be troublesome if this causes a logic hook loop of saves causing further
saves. One way around this is to simply be careful of the hooks that you
may trigger. If doing so is unavoidable you can usually set an
appropriate flag on the bean and then check for that flag in subsequent
hooks.

Think of the user
+++++++++++++++++

Most logic hooks will cause additional code which can degrade the users
experience. If you have long running code in the after_save the user
will need to wait for that code to run. This can be avoided by either
ensuring the code runs quickly or by using the Job Queue (see the Job
Queue chapter for more information).

[[scheduled-tasks]]
13. Scheduled Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[intro-2]]
Intro
^^^^^

Scheduled tasks are performed in SuiteCRM by the scheduler module. Jobs
are placed into the queue either through the defined scheduled tasks or,
for one off tasks, by code creating job objects. Note that both
scheduled tasks and using the job queue requires that you have the
schedulers set up. This will vary depending on your system but usually
requires adding an entry either to Cron (for Linux systems) or to the
windows scheduled tasks (for windows). Opening the scheduled tasks page
within SuiteCRM will let you know the format for the entry.

[[scheduler]]
Scheduler
^^^^^^^^^

Scheduled tasks allow SuiteCRM to perform recurring tasks. Examples of
these which ship with SuiteCRM include checking for incoming mail,
sending email reminder notifications and indexing the full text search.
What if you want to create your own tasks?

SuiteCRM lets you define your own Scheduler. We do this by creating a
file in +
`custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/`. You can give
this file a name of your choice but it is more helpful to give it a
descriptive name. Let’s create a simple file named +
`custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/CleanMeetingsScheduler.php`.
This will add a new job to the job strings and a new method that the
scheduler will call:

Example 13.1: Example Clean Meetings Scheduler

'''''

....
 1 &lt;?php
 2 /*
 3  * We add the method name to the $job_strings array.
 4  * This is the method that jobs for this scheduler will call.
 5  */
 6 $job_strings[] = 'cleanMeetingsScheduler';
 7 
 8 /**
 9  * Example scheduled job to change any 'Planned' meetings older than a month
10  * to 'Not Held'.
11  * @return bool
12  */
13 function cleanMeetingsScheduler(){
14   //Get the cutoff date for which meetings will be considered
15  $cutOff = new DateTime('now - 1 month');
16  $cutOff = $cutOff-&gt;format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
17 
18  //Get an instance of the meetings bean for querying
19   //see the Working With Beans chapter.
20   $bean = BeanFactory::getBean('Meetings');
21 
22   //Get the list of meetings older than the cutoff that are marked as Planned
23   $query = &quot;meetings.date_start &lt; '$cutOff' AND meetings.status = 'Planned'&quot;;
24   $meetings = $bean-&gt;get_full_list('',$query);
25 
26   foreach($meetings as $meeting){
27     //Mark each meeting as Not Held
28     $meeting-&gt;status = 'Not Held';
29     //Save the meeting changes
30     $meeting-&gt;save();
31   }
32   //Signify we have successfully ran
33   return true;
34 }
....

'''''

We also make sure that we add a language file in +
`custom/Extension/modules/Schedulers/Ext/Language/en_us.cleanMeetingsScheduler.php`
again, the name of the file doesn’t matter but it is helpful to use
something descriptive. This will define the language string for our job
so the user sees a nice label. See the section on language strings for
more information. The key for the mod strings will be
LBL_UPPERMETHODNAME. In our case our method name is
`cleanMeetingsScheduler` so our language label key will be
`LBL_CLEANMEETINGSSCHEDULER`.

Example 13.2: Example Language string for Clean Meetings Scheduler

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 //We add the mod string for our method here.
3 $mod_strings['LBL_CLEANMEETINGSSCHEDULER'] = 'Mark old, planned meetings as Not \
4 Held';
....

'''''

If we perform a repair and rebuild our method will now be packaged up
into the scheduler ext file (see the Extensions section for more
information on this process) and will be available in the schedulers
page. Note that for any changes to the scheduler method you will need to
perform another quick repair and rebuild - even in developer mode. We
can now create a new scheduler to call our new method:

image:images/CreateMeetingsScheduler.png[Creating a scheduler that uses
our new
method,title="fig:Creating a scheduler that uses our new method"]
Creating a scheduler that uses our new method

This will now behave just like any other scheduler and we can have this
run as often (or as rarely) as we would like. Take care here. The
default frequency is every one minute. If your task is heavy duty or
long running this may not be what you would prefer. Here we settle for
once a day.

[[job-queue]]
Job Queue
^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you will require code to perform a long running task but you
do not need the user to wait for this to be completed. A good example of
this is sending an email in a logic hook (see the Logic Hooks chapter
for information on these). Assuming we have the following logic hook:

Example 13.3: Example Email sending Logic Hook

'''''

....
 1 class SomeClass
 2 {
 3     function SomeMethod($bean, $event, $arguments)
 4     {
 5 
 6         //Perform some setup of the email class
 7         require_once &quot;include/SugarPHPMailer.php&quot;;
 8         $mailer=new SugarPHPMailer();
 9         $admin = new Administration();
10         $admin-&gt;retrieveSettings();
11         $mailer-&gt;prepForOutbound();
12         $mailer-&gt;setMailerForSystem();
13         $admin = new Administration();
14         $admin-&gt;retrieveSettings();
15         $admin-&gt;settings['notify_fromname']
16         $mailer-&gt;From     = $admin-&gt;settings['notify_fromaddress']
17         $mailer-&gt;FromName = $emailSettings['from_name'];
18         $mailer-&gt;IsHTML(true);
19 
20         //Add message and recipient.
21         //We could go all out here and load and populate an email template
22         //or get the email address from the bean
23         $mailer-&gt;Subject = 'My Email Notification! '.$bean-&gt;name;
24         $mailer-&gt;Body = $event. ' fired for bean '.$bean-&gt;name;
25         $mailer-&gt;AddAddress('Jim@example.com');
26         return $mailer-&gt;Send();
27     }
28 }
....

'''''

This will work fine. However you do not want the user to have to wait
for the email to be sent out as this can cause the UI to feel sluggish.
Instead you can create a Job and place it into the job queue and this
will be picked by the scheduler. Let’s look at an example of how you
would do this.

First we want our Logic Hook class to create the scheduled job:

Example 13.4: Example Scheduled Job Creation

'''''

....
 1 class SomeClass
 2 {
 3     function SomeMethod($bean, $event, $arguments)
 4     {
 5       require_once 'include/SugarQueue/SugarJobQueue.php';
 6       $scheduledJob = new SchedulersJob();
 7 
 8       //Give it a useful name
 9       $scheduledJob-&gt;name = &quot;Email job for {$bean-&gt;module_name} {$bean-&gt;id}&quot;;
10 
11       //Jobs need an assigned user in order to run. You can use the id
12       //of the current user if you wish, grab the assigned user from the
13       //current bean or anything you like.
14       //Here we use the default admin user id for simplicity
15       $scheduledJob-&gt;assigned_user_id = '1';
16 
17       //Pass the information that our Email job will need
18       $scheduledJob-&gt;data = json_encode(array(
19                                             'id' =&gt; $bean-&gt;id,
20                                             'module' =&gt; $bean-&gt;module_name)
21                                         );
22 
23       //Tell the scheduler what class to use
24       $scheduledJob-&gt;target = &quot;class::BeanEmailJob&quot;;
25 
26       $queue = new SugarJobQueue();
27       $queue-&gt;submitJob($scheduledJob);
28     }
29 }
....

'''''

Next we create the BeanEmailJob class. This is placed into the +
`custom/Extensions/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/` directory
with the same name as the class. So in our example we will have: +
`custom/Extensions/modules/Schedulers/Ext/ScheduledTasks/BeanEmailJob.php`

Example 13.5: Example Scheduler job

'''''

....
 1 class BeanEmailJob implements RunnableSchedulerJob
 2 {
 3   public function run($arguments)
 4   {
 5 
 6     //Only different part of the email code.
 7     //We grab the bean using the supplied arguments.
 8     $arguments = json_decode($arguments,1);
 9     $bean = BeanFactory::getBean($arguments['module'],$arguments['id']);
10 
11     //Perform some setup of the email class
12     require_once &quot;include/SugarPHPMailer.php&quot;;
13     $mailer=new SugarPHPMailer();
14     $admin = new Administration();
15     $admin-&gt;retrieveSettings();
16     $mailer-&gt;prepForOutbound();
17     $mailer-&gt;setMailerForSystem();
18     $admin = new Administration();
19     $admin-&gt;retrieveSettings();
20     $mailer-&gt;From     = $admin-&gt;settings['notify_fromaddress'];
21     $mailer-&gt;FromName = $emailSettings['from_name'];
22     $mailer-&gt;IsHTML(true);
23 
24     //Add message and recipient.
25     //We could go all out here and load and populate an email template
26     //or get the email address from the bean
27     $mailer-&gt;Subject = 'My Email Notification! '.$bean-&gt;name;
28     $mailer-&gt;Body = $event. ' fired for bean '.$bean-&gt;name;
29     $mailer-&gt;AddAddress('Jim@example.com');
30     return $mailer-&gt;Send();
31   }
32   public function setJob(SchedulersJob $job)
33   {
34     $this-&gt;job = $job;
35   }
36 }
....

'''''

Now whenever a user triggers the hook it will be much quicker since we
are simply persisting a little info to the database. The scheduler will
run this in the background.

[[retries]]
Retries
+++++++

Occasionally you may have scheduled jobs which could fail
intermittently. Perhaps you have a job which calls an external API. If
the API is unavailable it would be unfortunate if the job failed and was
never retried. Fortunately the SchedulersJob class has two properties
which govern how retries are handled. These are `requeue` and
`retry_count`.

`requeue`::
  Signifies that this job is eligible for retries.
`retry_count`::
  Signifies how many retries remain for this job. If the job fails this
  value will be decremented.

We can revisit our previous example and add two retries:

Example 13.6: Setting the retry count on a scheduled job

'''''

....
 6       $scheduledJob = new SchedulersJob();
 7 
 8       //Give it a useful name
 9       $scheduledJob-&gt;name = &quot;Email job for {$bean-&gt;module_name} {$bean-&gt;id}&quot;;
10 
11       //Jobs need an assigned user in order to run. You can use the id
12       //of the current user if you wish, grab the assigned user from the
13       //current bean or anything you like.
14       //Here we use the default admin user id for simplicity
15       $scheduledJob-&gt;assigned_user_id = '1';
16 
17       //Pass the information that our Email job will need
18       $scheduledJob-&gt;data = json_encode(array(
19                                             'id' =&gt; $bean-&gt;id,
20                                             'module' =&gt; $bean-&gt;module_name)
21                                         );
22 
23       //Tell the scheduler what class to use
24       $scheduledJob-&gt;target = &quot;class::BeanEmailJob&quot;;
25 
26       //Mark this job for 2 retries.
27       $scheduledJob-&gt;requeue = true;
28       $scheduledJob-&gt;retry = 2;
....

'''''

See the section on link:#chap11.xhtml#logic-hooks-chapter[logic hooks]
for more information on how job failures can be handled.

[[debugging]]
Debugging
^^^^^^^^^

With Scheduled tasks and jobs running in the background it can sometimes
be difficult to determine what is going on when things go wrong. If you
are debugging a scheduled task the the scheduled task page is a good
place to start. For both scheduled tasks and job queue tasks you can
also check the job_queue table. For example, in MySQL we can check the
last five scheduled jobs:

Example 13.7: Example MySQL query for listing jobs

'''''

....
SELECT * FROM job_queue ORDER BY date_entered DESC LIMIT 5
....

'''''

This will give us information on the last five jobs. Alternatively we
can check on specific jobs:

Example 13.8: Example MySQL query for listing BeanEmailJobs

'''''

....
SELECT * FROM job_queue WHERE target = 'class::BeanEmailJob'
....

'''''

In either case this will give details for the job(s):

Example 13.9: Example MySQL list of jobs

'''''

....
*************************** 1. row ***************************
assigned_user_id: 1
              id: 6cdf13d5-55e9-946e-9c98-55044c5cecee
            name: Email job for Accounts 103c4c9b-336f-0e87-782e-5501defb5900
         deleted: 0
    date_entered: 2015-03-14 14:58:15
   date_modified: 2015-03-14 14:58:25
    scheduler_id:
    execute_time: 2015-03-14 14:58:00
          status: done
      resolution: success
         message: NULL
          target: class::BeanEmailJob
            data: {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;103c4c9b-336f-0e87-782e-5501defb5900&quot;,&quot;module&quot;:&quot;Account\
s&quot;}
         requeue: 0
     retry_count: NULL
   failure_count: NULL
       job_delay: 0
          client: CRON3b06401793b3975cd00c0447c071ef9a:7781
percent_complete: NULL
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
....

'''''

Here we can check the status, resolution and message fields. If the
status is `queued` then either the scheduler has not yet run or it isn’t
running. Double check your Cron settings if this is the case.

It may be the case that the job has ran but failed for some reason. In
this case you will receive a message telling you to check the logs.
Checking the logs usually provides enough information, particularly if
you have made judicious use of logging (see the chapter on logging) in
your job.

It is possible that the job is failing outright, in which case your
logging may not receive output before the scheduler exits. In this case
you can usually check your PHP logs.

As a last resort you can manually run the scheduler from the SuiteCRM
directory using:

Example 13.10: Running the scheduler manually

'''''

....
php -f cron.php
....

'''''

Using this in addition to outputting any useful information should track
down even the oddest of bugs.

[[extension-framework]]
14. Extension Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[introduction-1]]
Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The extension framework provides a means to modify various application
data inside SuiteCRM. For example it provides a way to add or modify
vardefs, scheduled tasks, language strings and more. In general a folder
is provided in `custom/Extension` (the exact path depends on the
extension). This folder is then scanned for files which will be
consolidated into a single ext file which SuiteCRM will then read and
use. In this way it is possible for developers to add a new file to
affect the behaviour of SuiteCRM rather than altering existing files.
This makes the changes more modular and allows the easy addition or
removal of changes. Additionally, because these files are all
consolidated it means that there is no affect on performance of checking
a (possibly large) number of files. This is only done when performing a
repair and rebuild in the admin menu.

[[standard-extensions]]

global links (the list of links that appear in the top right of the
SuiteCRM UI).

scheduled tasks. See the chapter on
link:#chap12.xhtml#scheduled-tasks-chapter[Scheduled Tasks].

|UserPage |userpage.ext.php |Users |Unused

|JSGroupings |jsgroups.ext.php |  |Used to add, update or delete
JavaScript groupings.

|Actions |actions.ext.php |AOW_Actions |Used to add new WorkFlow
actions.
|=======================================================================

[[custom-extensions]]
Custom Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Interestingly the extension framework can be used to add new extensions.
This allows you to create customisations that are easily customised by
others (in a similar manner to, for example, how vardefs can be added -
see the chapter on link:#chap03.xhtml#vardefs-chapter[Vardefs]).

To create a custom extension you simply add a new file in +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Extensions`. This can be given a name
of your choosing. Our example will use +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Extensions/SportsList.php` and will
look like:

Example 14.1: Adding an entry point entry

'''''

....
1 &lt;?php
2 $extensions[&quot;sports_list&quot;] =  array(
3                 &quot;section&quot; =&gt; &quot;sports_list&quot;,
4                 &quot;extdir&quot; =&gt; &quot;SportsList&quot;,
5                 &quot;file&quot; =&gt; 'sportslist.ext.php',
6                 &quot;module&quot; =&gt; &quot;&quot;);
....

'''''

Now when a Quick Repair and rebuild is run any files in +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/SportsList/` will be consolidated
into +
`custom/application/Ext/SportsList/sportslist.ext.php`. On it’s own this
file will not do anything but you are now able to write custom code that
checks the consolidated file rather than having to worry about searching
for customisations.

1.  The language extensions are treated specially and, as such, aren’t
compiled to a single file.link:#chap13.xhtml#fnref-langNote[↩]

[[module-installer]]
15. Module Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As detailed in the other chapters of this book there are many ways to
customise SuiteCRM. The module installer allows you to package these
changes and install them onto other SuiteCRM instances. This is achieved
by creating a package.

At the minimum a package is a zip file that contains a `manifest.php`
file in it’s root. The manifest file is responsible for providing
information about the installer as well as providing information on how
to install the package.

[[manifest.php]]
manifest.php
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `manifest.php` file contains the definition of three arrays. Let’s
look at each of these arrays in turn. See
link:#chap19.xhtml#appendix-a[Appendix A] for the full sample
`manifest.php` file.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|image:images/leanpub_info-circle.png[information,title="fig:information",width=50]
|Within path in the manifest file you can use `<basepath>` to refer to
the base directory of the installer. For example `<basepath>/Foo.txt`
will refer to the `Foo.txt` file in the root of the installer package.
|=======================================================================

[[manifest]]
`$manifest`
+++++++++++

The `$manifest` array provides information on the package itself such as
it’s name, readme etc. (it also defines the `copy` array for `patch`
packages). A sample definition of the manifest array will appear
something like this:

Example 15.1: Example `$manifest` array definition

'''''

....
 1 $manifest = array(
 2   'name' =&gt; 'My First Package',
 3   'description' =&gt; 'This is a simple package example manifest file',
 4   'version' =&gt; '1.5',
 5   'author' =&gt; 'Jim Mackin',
 6   'readme' =&gt; 'readme.txt',
 7   'acceptable_sugar_flavors' =&gt; array('CE'),
 8   'acceptable_sugar_versions' =&gt; array(
 9     'exact_matches' =&gt; array(),
10     'regex_matches' =&gt; array('6\\.5\\.[0-9]$'),
11   ),
12   'copy_files' =&gt; array (
13     'from_dir' =&gt; '&lt;basepath&gt;/custom/',    
14     'to_dir' =&gt; 'custom',     
15     'force_copy' =&gt; array (),
16   ),
17   'dependencies' =&gt; array(
18     array(
19       'id_name' =&gt; 'example_dependency_package',
20       'version' =&gt; '2.4',
21     ),
22   ),
23 );
....

'''''

`name`::
  The name of the package. This is how the package will appear to the
  user during installation and in the Module Loader package list. The
  package name is required.
`description`::
  A brief description of the package.
`version`::
  The version of this package. This can be any string but is usually a
  traditional version number (such as `3.1.4`).
`author`::
  The author of the package.
`readme`::
  A brief readme string. Note that if a `README.txt` is found in the
  root of the package this will be used instead.
`acceptable_sugar_flavors`::
  A remnant of the SugarCRM packages. This should always be an array
  with (at least) a `CE` entry. If you would like the installer to
  target both SuiteCRM and SugarCRM editions then this can contain one
  of the other SugarCRM flavours (`PRO`, `CORP` , `ULT` or `ENT`).
`acceptable_sugar_versions`::
  An array detailing the matching SugarCRM versions. Note that the
  SugarCRM version is distinct from the SuiteCRM version. This array has
  two keys. `exact_matches` is simply an array of the allowed versions.
  `regex_matches` allows specifying regexes to match versions. For
  SuiteCRM you only need to worry about supporting the `6.5.*` versions
  which can be matched with the regex `6\\.5\\.[0-9]$`. At the time of
  writing the current SugarCRM version for SuiteCRM is `6.5.20`.
`copy_files`::
  This is only used for `patch` installers and will copy files in the
  `from_dir` key to those in the `to_dir` key. Finally the `force_copy`
  key can be used to specify files that should be forcibly copied over.
`dependencies`::
  An array of other packages that are relied on by this package. Each
  entry is an array with `id_name` - the id of the package and `version`
  - the required version of the package.

  The path (within the installer) to an icon to be displayed during
  installation.
`is_uninstallable`::
  Whether or not uninstalls should be allowed.
`published_date`::
  The date that the package was published. There is no fixed format for
  the date, it is simply a string.
`key`::
  Specifies a key to ensure that modules do not clash. This will prefix
  the installed modules and tables with `key`. This is used by the
  module builder when creating packages but can be specified if you
  wish.
`remove_tables`::
  A string specifying whether module tables should be removed when
  uninstalling this package. Accepted values are `true`, `false` and
  `prompt`. The default is `true`.
`type`::
  The type of the installer, one of `langpack`, `module`, `patch` or
  `theme`. See the types section.

[[api]]
16. API
~~~~~~~

The SuiteCRM API allows third party code to access and edit SuiteCRM
data and functionality.

[[using-the-api]]
Using the API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SuiteCRM has both a REST and a SOAP API. Which API you want to use will
largely come down to personal preference and the support for SOAP/REST
libraries in whichever language you will be using.

Both APIs will require a username and password. It is usual to create a
user specifically for the API.

[[soap]]
SOAP
++++

The WSDL for the SOAP API can be found at:

Example 16.1: SOAP API WSDL Location

'''''

....
example.com/suitecrm/service/v4_1/soap.php?wsdl
....

'''''

Where `example.com/suitecrm` is the address of your SuiteCRM instance.
`v4_1` is the version of the API and can be changed, `v4_1` is the
latest version at the time of writing.

[[soap-example]]
SOAP Example

The following PHP example uses the built in SoapClient class.

Example 16.2: Accessing the SOAP API

'''''

....
 1 &lt;?php
 2 //Create a new SoapClient
 3 $wsdlURL = &quot;http://example.com/suitecrm/service/v4_1/soap.php?wsdl&quot;;

[[rest]]
REST
++++

The SuiteCRM REST API can be found at:

Example 16.3: REST API Endpoint Location

'''''

....
example.com/suitecrm/service/v4_1/rest.php
....

'''''

Where example.com/suitecrm is the address of your SuiteCRM instance.
v4_1 is the version of the API and can be changed, v4_1 is the latest
version at the time of writing.

The SuiteCRM REST API is not a true REST API - all calls are performed
as POSTs and all calls are to the base URL with the method passed in as
a post argument.

The arguments to the REST API calls are: +
::

method

::
  The method which will be called, i.e. `login` or `get_entry_list`. See
  link:#chap20.xhtml#appendix-b[Appendix B] for a list of API methods.
input_type::
  The input type of the rest_data. This is usually `JSON` but can also
  be `Serialize`.
response_type::
  How the response will be encoded. This is usually `JSON` but can also
  be `Serialize`.
rest_data::
  Any other arguments that are required by this method. This is passed
  as an encoded array. The encoding is determined by input_type.

[[adding-custom-api-methods]]
Adding custom API methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes the existing API methods are not sufficient or using them for
a task would be overly complex. SuiteCRM allows the web services to be
extended with additional methods or overriding existing methods.

The recommended path for custom entry points is the following +
`custom/service/<version>_custom/`. At the time of writing the latest
web service version is `v4_1` so this would be
`custom/service/v4_1_custom/`.

Next we create the implementing class. This will create our new method.
In our example we will simply create a new method which writes to the
SuiteCRM log We will call this method +
`write_log_message`.

Example 16.5: Custom v4_1 Web Service Implementation

'''''

....
 1 &lt;?php
 2 if(!defined('sugarEntry')){
 3   define('sugarEntry', true);
 4 }
 5 require_once 'service/v4_1/SugarWebServiceImplv4_1.php';
 6 class SugarWebServiceImplv4_1_custom extends SugarWebServiceImplv4_1
 7 {
 8 
 9   function write_log_message($session, $message)
10   {
11     $GLOBALS['log']-&gt;info('Begin: write_log_message');
12 
13     //Here we check that $session represents a valid session
14     if (!self::$helperObject-&gt;checkSessionAndModuleAccess(
15                                                     $session, 
16                                                     'invalid_session', 
17                                                     '', 
18                                                     '', 
19                                                     '',  
20                                                     new SoapError()))
21     {
22       $GLOBALS['log']-&gt;info('End: write_log_message.');
23       return false;
24     }
25     $GLOBALS['log']-&gt;info($message);
26     return true;
27   }
28 }
....

'''''

Next we create the registry file which will register our new method.

Example 16.6: Custom v4_1 web service registry

'''''

....
 1 &lt;?php
 2     require_once 'service/v4_1/registry.php';
 3     class registry_v4_1_custom extends registry_v4_1
 4     {
 5         protected function registerFunction()
 6         {
 7             parent::registerFunction();
 8             $this-&gt;serviceClass-&gt;registerFunction('write_log_message', 
 9                                                   array(
10                                                     'session'=&gt;'xsd:string',
11                                                     'message'=&gt;'xsd:string'), 
12                                                   array(
13                                                     'return'=&gt;'xsd:boolean')
14                                                   );
15         }
16     }
....

'''''

Finally we create the entry point. This is the actual file that will be
called by our API clients. This will reference the two files which we
have created and will call the webservice implementation with our files.

Example 16.7: Custom v4_1 REST Entry point

'''''

....
 1 &lt;?php
 2 chdir('../../..');
 3 
 4 require_once 'SugarWebServiceImplv4_1_custom.php';

11 $location = 'custom/service/v4_1_custom/rest.php';

[[usage-1]]
Usage
+++++

We can now use our custom endpoint. This is identical to using the API
as detailed above, except that we use our custom entry point for either
the SOAP WSDL or REST URL. For example using the same SuiteCRM location
(`example.com/suitecrm`) as the above examples and using `v4_1`, we
would use the following

[[best-practices]]
17. Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[development-instances]]
Development instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When making changes you should always use a development or test instance
first. This allows you to fully and safely test any changes.

[[version-control]]
Version control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When developing customisations it is prudent to use some form of version
control. Version control allows tracking changes to your codebase in
addition to rolling back changes. There are many version control systems
available. SuiteCRM uses http://git-scm.com/[Git] although I also like
http://mercurial.selenic.com/[Mercurial].

If you are using a development instance (as mentioned above) then
Version Control usually allows you to push changes to other versions or
to tag releases. This provides a way of pushing changes to live or test
instances safely. Crucially it also means that, should there be major
problems with a version then this can be easily rolled back.

[[backup]]
Backup
^^^^^^

SuiteCRM has been developed to be customisable. However, mistakes, bugs
and other unpleasantness can (and thanks to Murphy’s law, will) happen.
You should always ensure, before making any changes, that you have a
backup of all files and of the database.

In order to back up files you can simply create a zip of the SuiteCRM
directory and copy it to a safe place. On Linux systems this can be
performed using the following:

Example 17.1: File backup

'''''

....
tar -czvf suitecrmfilebackup.tar.gz /path/to/suitecrm
....

'''''

Backing up the SuiteCRM database will vary depending on which database
you are using. However MySQL backups can be performed using the
`mysqldump` command on Linux as seen here:

Example 17.2: MySQL Database backup

'''''

....
mysqldump suitecrmdatabase -u databaseuser -p | gzip -c | cat &gt; suitecrm.sql.gz
....

'''''

[[be-upgrade-safe]]
Be upgrade safe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless you are making changes to a custom module you should strive in
all cases to use the custom framework and make changes in the custom
folder. This ensures that, should you make a mistake, rectifying the
mistake is as simple as removing the customisation.

However the main advantage to using `custom` is that, when you upgrade
SuiteCRM in the future you will not have your changes overwritten by the
updated SuiteCRM files. See the
link:#chap13.xhtml#extensions-chapter[Extensions] chapter for more
information.

[[use-appropriate-log-levels]]
Use appropriate log levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using appropriate log levels (See the chapter on
link:#chap10.xhtml#logging-chapter[Logging]) makes it easier to track
down issues. You do not want very important messages to be logged as
`debug` since this will make them difficult to find. Likewise you don’t
want unimportant log messages cluttering up the `fatal` log output.

[[long-running-logic-hooks]]
Long running logic hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a logic hook task is long running then you should place it into the
job queue (see the link:#chap11.xhtml#logic-hooks-chapter[Logic Hook]
and link:#chap12.xhtml#scheduled-tasks-chapter[Scheduled Tasks]
chapters).

[[minimise-sql]]
Minimise SQL
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Where possible you should strive to use the SuiteCRM supplied methods of
accessing data. This includes using beans and the BeanFactory where
possible (see the chapter on
link:#chap02.xhtml#working-with-beans-chapter[Working with beans]).
There are a few reasons for this. The first is that SQL is usually
either hardcoded or has to be dynamically built. In the case where the
SQL is hardcoded this means that changes to fields will not be reflected
thereby making your code more brittle.

Dynamic SQL is better because it can react to field changes and
generally be tailored to fit the situation. However this requires adding
extra, often complex, code. It can be hard to account for all situations
(this can be especially problematic when attempting to traverse
relationships dynamically).

Another issue is that, usually SQL will end up being Database specific
(see the next point for mitigating this however).

Finally any custom logic (such as Logic Hooks) which would usually be
fired for saving beans or relationships will not be fired for SQL
queries.

[[sql-use]]
SQL Use
^^^^^^^

In some cases using raw SQL is unavoidable. If that is the case then you
should strive to use standard compliant SQL. If database engine specific
features need to be used, and you wish to target other database engines,
you can check for the DB type. For example:

Example 17.1: Checking for the database engine

'''''

....
 1 function getSomeSQLQuery(){
 2     global $sugar_config;
 3     switch($sugar_config['dbconfig']['db_type']){
 4         case 'mssql':
 5             $sql = 'MSSQL specific SQL';
 6             break;
 7         case 'mysql':
 8         default:
 9             $sql = 'MySQL specific SQL';
10             break;
11     }
12     return $sql;
13 }
....

'''''

[[entry-check]]
Entry check
^^^^^^^^^^^

The majority of SuiteCRM files will start with some variation of the
following line:

Example 17.2: Entry check

'''''

....
if(!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
....

'''''

This prevents direct access to the file by ensuring that SuiteCRM has
been loaded through a valid entry point (i.e. it has been loaded through
index.php, cron.php or a custom entry point).

[[redirect-after-post]]
Redirect after post
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you may have custom controller actions (see the controller
section) or custom entry points (see the
link:#chap07.xhtml#entry-point-chapter[Entry Points] chapter). These
actions and entry points or other pages are usually accessed using POST.
After a POST request it is a web best practice to redirect to a
different page, especially if your page makes any changes. This prevents
the user from refreshing the page and causing a duplicate action. Within
SuiteCRM it is best to use the `SugarApplication::redirect` method to
redirect. This simply accepts a URL. As follows:

Example 17.3: Redirecting within SuiteCRM

'''''

....
SugarApplication::redirect('index.php?module=&lt;TheModule&gt;');
....

'''''

[[performance-tweaks]]
18. Performance Tweaks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases the performance of SuiteCRM should not be an issue.
However in the case of large datasets or systems with many users you may
notice some performance degradation. These changes can help improve
performance.

[[server]]
Server
^^^^^^

The server that SuiteCRM runs on is, of course, very important when it
comes to the kind of performance you can expect. A full guide on server
setup is outside the scope of this book. However there are some things
you can do to ensure that you get the best performance out of SuiteCRM.

[[php]]
PHP
+++

Installing a PHP opcode cache will increase the performance of all PHP
files. These work by caching the compilation of PHP files resulting in
less work on each request. Furthermore SuiteCRM will use the caching API
of some PHP accelerators which will further increase performance. If you
are using Linux then http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php[APC] is the
usual choice. Windows users should check out
http://php.net/manual/en/book.wincache.php[WinCache].

[[mysql]]
MySQL
+++++

MySQL is notorious for having small default settings. Fully optimising
MySQL is outside the scope of this book (however checkout
http://mysqltuner.pl[mysqltuner.pl] for a helpful Perl script which will
provide setting recommendations - note that you should be careful when
running files from an unknown source). One small change that can make a
big difference is increasing the `innodb_buffer_pool_size`.

If you have migrated or imported a significant amount of data it is
possible that some tables will be fragmented. Running
`OPTIMIZE TABLE tablename` can increase performance.

[[indexes]]
Indexes
^^^^^^^

Adding indexes on the fields of modules can improve database
performance. The core modules usually have important fields indexed.
However if you have created a new module or added new, often searched
fields to a module then these fields may benefit from being indexed. See
the link:#chap03.xhtml#vardefs-chapter[Vardef] chapter for adding
indexes.

[[config-changes]]
Config Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following are some config settings that can be used to improve
performance. Please note that in most cases you will have better
performance gains by first following the steps in previous sections.
These settings should be set in the config_override.php file. See the
chapter on the link:#chap09.xhtml#config-chapter[Config] files for more
information.

....
$sugar_config['developerMode'] = false;
....

Unless you are actively developing on an instance developerMode should
be off. Otherwise each page request will cause cached files to be
reloaded.

....
$sugar_config['disable_count_query'] = true;
....

For systems with large amounts of data the count queries on subpanels
used for the pagination controls can become slow thereby causing the
page to be sluggish or outright slow to load. Disabling these queries
can improve performance dramatically on some pages.

....
$sugar_config['disable_vcr'] = true;
....

By default opening the detail view of a record from the list view will
also load the other records in the list to allow for easy moving through
records. If you do not use this feature, or, if loading the detail view
for some records has become slow, you can disable this feature.

....
$sugar_config['list_max_entries_per_page'] = '10';
....

The number of records shown in each page of the list view can be
decreased. This will result in a slight increase in performance on list
view pages.

....
$sugar_config['logger']['level'] = 'fatal';
....

Lowering the log level means that there will be less log messages to
write to disk on each request. This will slightly (very slightly)
increase performance.

[[appendix-a---code-examples]]
20. Appendix A - Code Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[metadata-1]]
Metadata
^^^^^^^^

This is an example of setting up a function subpanel (see the
link:#chap05.xhtml#metadata-chapter[Metadata] chapter for more
information).

In this example the cases module has a custom field `incident_code_c`
which is used to track cases with the same root cause. We’ll add a
subpanel to show all cases that have the same `incident_code_c`.

Initially we add to the `subpanel_setup` section of Cases by creating
the following file in
`custom/Extension/modules/Cases/Ext/Layoutdefs/IncidentLayoutdefs.php`

Example A.1: `IncidentLayoutdefs.php`

'''''

....
 1 &lt;?php
 2 $layout_defs[&quot;Cases&quot;][&quot;subpanel_setup&quot;]['incident_cases'] = array(
 3   'module' =&gt; 'Cases',
 4   'title_key' =&gt; 'LBL_INCIDENT_CASES',
 5   'subpanel_name' =&gt; 'default',
 6   'get_subpanel_data' =&gt; 'function:get_cases_by_incident',
 7   'function_parameters' =&gt; 
 8           array('import_function_file' =&gt; 'custom/modules/Cases/IncidentUtils.ph\
 9 p',),
10 );
....

'''''

Next we create the file which will define our `get_cases_by_incident`
function `custom/modules/Cases/IncidentUtils.php`.

Example A.2: `IncidentUtils.php`

'''''

....
 1 &lt;?php
 2 function get_cases_by_incident(){
 3         global $db;
 4         //Get the current bean
 5         $bean = $GLOBALS['app']-&gt;controller-&gt;bean;
 6         $incidentCode = $db-&gt;quote($bean-&gt;incident_code_c);
 7         //Create the SQL array
 8         $ret = array();
 9         $ret['select'] = ' SELECT id FROM cases ';
10         $ret['from'] = ' FROM cases ';
11         $ret['join'] = &quot;&quot;;
12         //Get all cases where the incident code matches but exclude the current \
13 case.
14         $ret['where']=&quot;WHERE cases.deleted = 0 AND cases_cstm.incident_code_c = \
15 '{$incidentCode}' AND cases.id != '{$bean-&gt;id}'&quot;;
16         return $ret;
17 }
